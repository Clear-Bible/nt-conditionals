# nt-conditionals
Data regarding conditional statements/clauses in the NT provided by Rachel and Mike Aubrey and CanIL (Steve Nicolle)

# license
Rick's understanding is that this is CC-BY-4.0 or equivalent (and am confirming). The NA27 are segments/phrases so should be fine, but even then we will map the NA27 to SBLGNT and only distribute the SBLGNT-based editon.

# supplied data
Rachel and Mike Aubrey supplied four files; two excel spreadsheets and two PDFs. Another edition of the data, without Greek protasis or apodosis specified, is also availble. These are in the `data/raw` folder of this repo.
