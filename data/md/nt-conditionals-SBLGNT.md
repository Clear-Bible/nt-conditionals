# Matt 4:3: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you are the Son of God)
q: (command these stones to become bread)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ θεοῦ
* _q1_: εἰπὲ ἵνα οἱ λίθοι οὗτοι ἄρτοι γένωνται


## Notes
P presents a fact that the temptor knew to be true. The devil certainly knows Jesus' identity. Hagner (1993) notes that this might as well be translated "since", as the devil is testing Jesus' obedience to the Father rather than questioning his identity. Q presents the subsequent command Jesus is being tempted to obey.


----------------

# Matt 4:6: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you are the Son of God)
q: (throw yourself down)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ θεοῦ
* _q1_: βάλε σεαυτὸν κάτω


## Notes
As with 4:3, this conditional expresses no doubt about Jesus' identity, but is being used to manipulate, tempt, and challenge him.


----------------

# Matt 4:9: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise / Exhort


## English
q:(All these I will give you)
p: (if you will fall down and worship me)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἐὰν πεσὼν προσκυνήσῃς μοι
* _p1_: Ταῦτά σοι πάντα δώσω


## Notes
In 4:3 and 4:6 the exhortations (or temptations) are direct and occur in q; in this verse the exhortation (or temptation) is made indirectly in p. Though highly unlikely, and though it did not come to pass, this was still a (remote) possibility when the devil spoke it. It was a real option for Jesus, though he did not take it. Unlike the two previous temptations, this one is a third class, using εαν with the subjunctive because ( according to Hagner 1993) it involves an actual unmet condition.


----------------

# Matt 5:13a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if salt has lost its taste)
q: (how shall its saltiness be restored?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ τὸ ἅλας μωρανθῇ
* _q1_: ἐν τίνι ἁλισθήσεται


## Notes
This conditional must be read in its context of describing discipleship. The connection between salt and discipleship is that, as Marshall (1978) puts it, "a false form of discipleship may look like salt, but the gradual process of leeching leaves only a zestless pile of waste."


----------------

# Matt 5:20: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees)
q: (you will never enter the kingdom of heaven)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ περισσεύσῃ ὑμῶν ἡ δικαιοσύνη πλεῖον τῶν γραμματέων καὶ Φαρισαίων
* _q1_: οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν


## Notes
Greek: εαν μη. Nolland, Hagner, and others agree that the righteousness Jesus discusses here cannot mean that he is actually commanding the disciples to live by the letter of the law as the Pharisees do (and to a greater extent, which is nigh impossible). 
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): For I say to you that only if you are more righteous than the scribes and Pharisees, will you enter the kingdom of heaven.


----------------

# Matt 5:23-24: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,)
q: (v.24 leave your gift there before the alter and go)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV: See Notes


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὖν προσφέρῃς τὸ δῶρόν σου ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κἀκεῖ μνησθῇς ὅτι ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἔχει τι κατὰ σοῦ
* _q1_: ἄφες ἐκεῖ τὸ δῶρόν σου ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ ὕπαγε


## Notes
P consists of two clauses: 1) offering your gift at the altar, and 2) remember that your brother has something against you. in most English translations "if" covers both of these, but NRSV introduces each separately with "when" and "if" respectively: "So when you are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there..." This could be a good model to follow in some languages.


----------------

# Matt 5:29: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Exhort


## English
p: (if your right eye causes you to sin)
q: (tear it out and throw it away)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου ὁ δεξιὸς σκανδαλίζει σε
* _q1_: ἔξελε αὐτὸν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ


## Notes
This conditional uses figurative langauge describing a situation.
The conditional is class 3 in Mark 9:47 and class 1 here in Matthew. It could be that Mark was more focused on the potentiality of different types of sins. Mark 9:47 and its related verses come in a longer list of various possible stumbling blocks. Matthew perhaps had in view the point that sin is more common and more strictly judged than was commonly taught. It was therefore framed in his account as "determined as fulfilled" due to the context of what was being said.


----------------

# Matt 5:30: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Exhort


## English
p: (if your right hand causes you to sin)
q: (cut it off and throw it away)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἡ δεξιά σου χεὶρ σκανδαλίζει σε
* _q1_: ἔκκοψον αὐτὴν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ


## Notes
See note on 5:29.


----------------

# Matt 5:46: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if you love those who love you)
q: (what reward do you have?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γὰρ ἀγαπήσητε τοὺς ἀγαπῶντας ὑμᾶς
* _q1_: τίνα μισθὸν ἔχετε


## Notes
In this verse, q is a rhetorical question that expects the answer "No reward at all." Jesus' point is that loving those who love you is a common situation that is not unique or especially commendable. He uses it to support his command that the disciples should love their enemies.


----------------

# Matt 5:47: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
modifications in brackets
p: (if you greet only your brothers)
q: (what more are you doing than others?) [you are not doing anything more than others]


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀσπάσησθε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν μόνον
* _q1_: τί περισσὸν ποιεῖτε


## Notes
See note on 5:46.


----------------

# Matt 6:1: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
NIV, clarification in brackets
p: (if you do) [practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them]
q: (you will have no reward from your Father in heaven)


* ESV, NRSV: "for then"
NASB: "otherwise"
NIV: "If you do"
NLT: "for"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή γε
* _q1_: μισθὸν οὐκ ἔχετε παρὰ τῷ πατρὶ ὑμῶν τῷ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή γε with an elided (understood) verb.
English translations express the constrcution εἰ δὲ μή γε in a variety of ways; the NIV translation shows how it is related to a conditional meaning.


----------------

# Matt 6:14: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise / Assert


## English
p: (if you forgive others their trespasses)
q: (your heavenly Father will also forgive you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γὰρ ἀφῆτε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ παραπτώματα αὐτῶν
* _q1_: ἀφήσει καὶ ὑμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος


----------------

# Matt 6:15: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Assert


## English
p: (if you do not forgive others their trespasses 
q: (neither will your Father forgive your trespasses)


* ESV, NRSV: "if...neither"
NASB: "if...then"
NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἀφῆτε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις
* _q1_: οὐδὲ ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ἀφήσει τὰ παραπτώματα


## Notes
The situation described in this conditional is the opposite of 6:14.


----------------

# Matt 6:22: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Assert


## English
p: (if your eye is healthy)
q: (your whole body will be full of light)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NASB: "then if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὖν ᾖ ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου ἁπλοῦς
* _q1_: ὅλον τὸ σῶμά σου φωτεινὸν ἔσται


----------------

# Matt 6:23: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Assert


## English
p: (if your eye is bad)
q: (your whole body will be full of darkness)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου πονηρὸς ᾖ
* _q1_: ὅλον τὸ σῶμά σου σκοτεινὸν ἔσται


----------------

# Matt 6:23: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Assert


## English
p: (if then the light in you is darkness)
q: (how great is the darkness)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if then"
NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν τὸ φῶς τὸ ἐν σοὶ σκότος ἐστίν
* _q1_: τὸ σκότος πόσον


----------------

# Matt 6:30: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue / Encourage


## English
p: (if God so clothes the grass of the field...)
q: (will he not much more clothe you?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ τὸν χόρτον τοῦ ἀγροῦ σήμερον ὄντα καὶ αὔριον εἰς κλίβανον βαλλόμενον ὁ θεὸς οὕτως ἀμφιέννυσιν
* _q1_: οὐ πολλῷ μᾶλλον ὑμᾶς ὀλιγόπιστοι


## Notes
P is factual, and q is a rhetorical question expecting an affirmative response: "God will indeed clothe his people."


----------------

# Matt 7:9: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
What man among you
p: (if his son asks him for bread)
q: (will give him a stone)?


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NASB: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃν αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἄρτον
* _q1_: μὴ λίθον ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ


## Notes
Although there is no conditional marker in the Greek, the sense here is clearly conditional. Jesus is asking his hearers to consider a hypothetical but commonplace scenario (a child asking for food) and an almost unthinkable response (a father giving the child something inedible and dangerous). Almost all English translations translate these verses as conditional sentences. The probability "likely" refers to the probability of p, not the probability of q (which is very unlikely to happen).


----------------

# Matt 7:10: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: or (if he asks for an fish)
q: (will give him a snake)?


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἢ καὶ ἰχθὺν αἰτήσει
* _q1_: μὴ ὄφιν ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ


## Notes
See note at 7:9


----------------

# Matt 7:11: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children)
q: (how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν ὑμεῖς πονηροὶ ὄντες οἴδατε δόματα ἀγαθὰ διδόναι τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν
* _q1_: πόσῳ μᾶλλον ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς δώσει ἀγαθὰ τοῖς αἰτοῦσιν αὐτόν


## Notes
In the previous sentences, Jesus has just used rhetorical questions to highlight the fact that his listeners would indeed not want to give bad gifts to their children (e.g. a snake).


----------------

# Matt 8:2: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you will)
q: (you can make me clean)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν θέλῃς δύνασαί με
* _q1_: καθαρίσαι


## Notes
Jesus is able to make the man clean regardless of his will to do so. Many commentators agree that the man is not expressing any doubt as to Jesus' power, but the conditional merely expresses his doubt as to Jesus' willingness.


----------------

# Matt 8:31: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you cast us out)
q: (send us away into the herd of pigs)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἐκβάλλεις ἡμᾶς
* _q1_: ἀπόστειλον ἡμᾶς εἰς τὴν ἀγέλην τῶν χοίρων


## Notes
The probability is listed as Very Likely and the time as Future because the demons recognized Jesus and could easily guess his intentions. However, a possible alternative interpretation (supported by the parallel in Mark 5:12) is that this is a Factual Present condition with the meaning "Since you are casting us out..."


----------------

# Matt 9:17: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if it is)
q: (the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed)


* ESV, NIV: "if"
NASB, NRSV: "otherwise"
NLT: "for"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή γε
* _q1_: ῥήγνυνται οἱ ἀσκοί καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἐκχεῖται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοὶ ἀπόλλυνται


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή γε with an elided (understood) verb. 
See note on 6:1.


----------------

# Matt 9:21: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Not applicable


## English
p: (if I only touch his garment)
q: (I will be made well)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν μόνον ἅψωμαι τοῦ ἱματίου αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: σωθήσομαι


## Notes
The illocutionary force category is not applicable here as the woman is speaking only to herself (which is Matthew's way of describing her thoughts).


----------------

# Matt 10:13a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if the house is worthy)
q: (let your peace come upon it)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὲν ᾖ ἡ οἰκία ἀξία
* _q1_: ἐλθάτω ἡ εἰρήνη ὑμῶν ἐπ αὐτήν


----------------

# Matt 10:13b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if it is not worthy)
q: (let your peace return to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ᾖ ἀξία
* _q1_: ἡ εἰρήνη ὑμῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐπιστραφήτω


----------------

# Matt 10:25: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Argue


## English
modified to reflect the Greek more literally
p: (if they have called the master of the house Beelzebul)
q: (how much more the members of his household)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ τὸν οἰκοδεσπότην Βεελζεβοὺλ ἐπεκάλεσαν
* _q1_: πόσῳ μᾶλλον τοὺς οἰκιακοὺς αὐτοῦ


## Notes
Jesus claims q is more likely than p. Since p is in fact a true condition, he is arguing and warning that q will indeed happen by using figurative terms.


----------------

# Matt 11:14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if you are willing to accept it)
q: (he is Elijah, who is to come)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ θέλετε δέξασθαι
* _q1_: αὐτός ἐστιν Ἠλίας ὁ μέλλων ἔρχεσθαι


## Notes
Q is a fact that is true regardless of p (i.e. whether the hearers are willing to accept it)..


----------------

# Matt 11:21: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon)
q: (they would have repented long ago)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγένοντο αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν
* _q1_: πάλαι ἂν ἐν σάκκῳ καὶ σποδῷ μετενόησαν


## Notes
P did not, in fact, occur and neither did q. Jesus here uses the example of Tyre and Sidon to rebuke Bethsaida and Chorazin.


----------------

# Matt 11:23: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom)
q: (it would have remained until this day)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐν Σοδόμοις ἐγενήθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν σοί
* _q1_: ἔμεινεν ἂν μέχρι τῆς σήμερον


## Notes
P did not, in fact, occur and neither did q. Jesus here uses the example of Sodom to rebuke Capernaum.


----------------

# Matt 12:7: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if you had known what this means, "I desire mercy and not sacrifice")
q: (you would not have condemned the guiltless)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
(NLT inverts p and q in translation)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἐγνώκειτε τί ἐστιν Ἔλεος θέλω καὶ οὐ θυσίαν
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν κατεδικάσατε τοὺς ἀναιτίους


## Notes
Jesus rebukes the pharisees by implying that they did not know the meaning of Scripture and therefore had condemned the innocent.


----------------

# Matt 12:11: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if it [a sheep] falls into a pit on the Sabbath)
q: (will [he] not take hold of it and lift it out)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV: "suppose"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ ἐὰν ἐμπέσῃ τοῦτο τοῖς σάββασιν εἰς βόθυνον
* _q1_: οὐχὶ κρατήσει αὐτὸ καὶ ἐγερεῖ


## Notes
English translations offer a variety of structures for this conditional; for example, NIV includes "any of you has a sheep" within the scope of the conditional. The Greek has και εαν following the phrase "who has one sheep" and just preceeding the subjunctive verb "fall". Though και εαν sometimes expresses a concessive ("even if") conditonal, here it simply means "and if". 
Jesus' use of a rhetorical question in q assumes an affirmative answer.


----------------

# Matt 12:26: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if Satan casts out Satan)
q: (he is divided against himself)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὁ Σατανᾶς τὸν Σατανᾶν ἐκβάλλει
* _q1_: ἐφ ἑαυτὸν ἐμερίσθη


## Notes
A false situation which Jesus presents as possible for the sake of argument in order to show that Q is ridiculous.


----------------

# Matt 12:27: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if I cast out demons by Beelzebul)
q: (by whom do your sons cast them out)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐγὼ ἐν Βεελζεβοὺλ ἐκβάλλω τὰ δαιμόνια
* _q1_: οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἐν τίνι ἐκβάλλουσιν


## Notes
See note on 12:26.


----------------

# Matt 12:28: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if it is by the Spirit of God I cast out demons)
q: (then the kingdom of God has come upon you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἐν πνεύματι θεοῦ ἐγὼ ἐκβάλλω τὰ δαιμόνια
* _q1_: ἄρα ἔφθασεν ἐφ ὑμᾶς ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ


## Notes
P is factual, though Jesus' audience may not yet be convinced of it. Here Jesus furthers the argument beyond, "Is he casting out demons by Beelzebul or by the Spirit?" to "What does it mean that he IS casting out by the Spirit?"


----------------

# Matt 12:29: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods)
p: (unless he first binds the strong man?)


* ESV, NIV, NASB: "unless"
NRSV: "without"
NLT: untranslated ("only")


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἢ πῶς δύναταί τις εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἁρπάσαι
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ πρῶτον δήσῃ τὸν ἰσχυρόν


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'unless'.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except', and avoiding rhetorical question): A person can only enter the strong man's house and carry off/steal his property if he first binds the strong man.
NLT: "For who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods? Only someone even stronger—someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house."


----------------

# Matt 14:28: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present

## English
p: (if it is you)
q: (command me to come to you on the water)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"

* _q1_: ἀμφότεροι εἰς βόθυνον πεσοῦνται


----------------

# Matt 16:24: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely

## English
p: (if anyone would come after me)
q: (let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "if"
NIV: "whoever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις θέλει ὀπίσω μου ἐλθεῖν
* _q1_: ἀπαρνησάσθω ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἀράτω τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀκολουθείτω μοι


## Notes
Greek: εἴ τις 'if anyone'
Probability is based on the fact that most of the audience Jesus is speaking to wanted to follow him.


----------------

# Matt 16:26: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
q: (what will it profit a man)
p: (if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "if"
NIV: "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τί γὰρ ὠφεληθήσεται ἄνθρωπος
* _p1_: ἐὰν τὸν κόσμον ὅλον κερδήσῃ τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ζημιωθῇ


## Notes
This verse contains two rhetorical questions (this conditional sentence, and a non-conditional sentence). The expected answer to both is "Nothing."


----------------

# Matt 17:4: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you wish)
q: (I will make three tents here)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ θέλεις
* _q1_: ποιήσω ὧδε τρεῖς σκηνάς


## Notes
Parallel verses do not have a conditional connective.


----------------

# Matt 17:20: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed)
q: (you will say to this mountain "Move..." and it will move)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἔχητε πίστιν ὡς κόκκον σινάπεως
* _q1_: ἐρεῖτε τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ Μετάβα ἔνθεν ἐκεῖ καὶ μεταβήσεται


----------------

# Matt 18:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (unless you turn and become like children)
q: (you will never enter the kingdom of God)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ στραφῆτε καὶ γένησθε ὡς τὰ παιδία
* _q1_: οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'unless'
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "Truly I say to you, only if you change/turn and become like children, will you enter the kingdom of heaven."


----------------

# Matt 18:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Exhort


## English
p: (if your hand or foot causes you to sin)
q: (cut it off and throw it away)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δὲ ἡ χείρ σου ἢ ὁ πούς σου σκανδαλίζει σε
* _q1_: ἔκκοψον αὐτὸν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ


## Notes
See note on 5:30.


----------------

# Matt 18:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Exhort


## English
p: (if your eye causes you to sin)
q: (tear it out and throw it away)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζει σε
* _q1_: ἔξελε αὐτὸν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ


## Notes
See note on 5:29.


----------------

# Matt 18:12: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray)
q: (does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that never went astray?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γένηταί τινι ἀνθρώπῳ ἑκατὸν πρόβατα καὶ πλανηθῇ ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν
* _q1_: οὐχὶ ἀφήσει τὰ ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη καὶ πορευθεὶς ζητεῖ τὸ πλανώμενον


## Notes
Jesus introduces a parable here that gets a more detailed and less conditional treatment in Luke. In this verse he asks a rhetorical question that expects a postive response.


----------------

# Matt 18:13: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if he finds it)
q: (he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γένηται εὑρεῖν αὐτό
* _q1_: ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι χαίρει ἐπ αὐτῷ μᾶλλον ἢ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα τοῖς μὴ πεπλανημένοις


----------------

# Matt 18:15a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if your brother sins against you)
q: (go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν δὲ ἁμαρτήσῃ εἰς σὲ ὁ ἀδελφός σου
* _q1_: ὕπαγε ἔλεγξον αὐτὸν μεταξὺ σοῦ καὶ αὐτοῦ μόνου


## Notes
In this verse, Jesus brings up the topic of dealing with sin in the church. The specific focus continues through v.17 as Jesus builds each subsquent conditonal on the last one. He presents multiple situations and instructs the disciples what to do in each of the cases.


----------------

# Matt 18:15b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if he listens to you)
q: (you have gained your brother)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν σου ἀκούσῃ
* _q1_: ἐκέρδησας τὸν ἀδελφόν σου


## Notes
See note on 18:15.


----------------

# Matt 18:16: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (but if he does not listen)
q: (take one or two others along with you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἀκούσῃ
* _q1_: παράλαβε μετὰ σοῦ ἔτι ἕνα ἢ δύο ἵνα ἐπὶ στόματος δύο μαρτύρων ἢ τριῶν σταθῇ πᾶν ῥῆμα


## Notes
See note on 18:15.


----------------

# Matt 18:17a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if he refuses to listen to them)
q: (tell it to the church)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ παρακούσῃ αὐτῶν
* _q1_: εἰπὸν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ


## Notes
See note on 18:15.


----------------

# Matt 18:17b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if he refuses to listen to the church)
q: (let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ καὶ τῆς ἐκκλησίας παρακούσῃ ἔστω σοι ὥσπερ ὁ ἐθνικὸς καὶ ὁ τελώνης
* _q1_: ἔστω σοι ὥσπερ ὁ ἐθνικὸς καὶ ὁ τελώνης

----------------

# Matt 18:19a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic

## English
p: (if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask)
q: (it will be done for them by my Father in heaven)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δύο συμφωνήσωσιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς περὶ παντὸς πράγματος οὗ ἐὰν αἰτήσωνται
* _q1_: γενήσεται αὐτοῖς παρὰ τοῦ πατρός μου τοῦ ἐν οὐρανοῖς


----------------

# Matt 18:35: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
q: (so also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you)
p: (if you do not forgive your brother from your heart)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV "if...not"
NIV: "unless"
NLT: "if you refuse..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Οὕτως καὶ ὁ πατήρ μου ὁ οὐράνιος ποιήσει ὑμῖν
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἀφῆτε ἕκαστος τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν καρδιῶν ὑμῶν


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'if not', 'unless'


----------------

# Matt 19:10: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if such is the case of a man with his wife)
q: (it is better not to marry)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ οὕτως ἐστὶν ἡ αἰτία τοῦ ἀνθρώπου μετὰ τῆς γυναικός
* _q1_: οὐ συμφέρει γαμῆσαι


## Notes
"If such is the case" refers back to Jesus' teaching in vs.8 & 9. If a conditional will make it sound as if the disciples are doubting Jesus, you could use an expression such as "In that case" or even "That teaching is hard!"


----------------

# Matt 19:17b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Command


## English
p: (if you wish to enter into life)
q: (keep the commandments) (NASB/NRSV)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ θέλεις εἰς τὴν ζωὴν εἰσελθεῖν
* _q1_: τήρησον τὰς ἐντολάς


## Notes
In v.16 someone asked Jesus, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” This man clearly wanted eternal life, so the s conditional is factual.


----------------

# Matt 19:21: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if you would be perfect)
q: (go, sell what you possess and give to the poor...)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ θέλεις τέλειος εἶναι
* _q1_: ὕπαγε πώλησόν σου τὰ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ δὸς πτωχοῖς καὶ ἕξεις θησαυρὸν ἐν οὐρανοῖς καὶ δεῦρο ἀκολούθει μοι


## Notes
In the previous verse, the young man told Jesus that he had kept all the commandments, and then asked "What do I still lack?" This shows that τέλειος "perfect" here means to keep the commandments completely. This is something that the young man wants to do, so the conditional is factual.


----------------

# Matt 21:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if anyone says anything to you)
q: (you shall say, "the Lord needs them")


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ τι
* _q1_: ἐρεῖτε ὅτι Ὁ κύριος αὐτῶν χρείαν ἔχει


## Notes
Greek: εαν τις 'if anyone'


----------------

# Matt 21:21a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Promise


## English
p: (if you have faith and don't doubt)
q: (you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, "Be taken up and thrown into the sea", it will happen)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if you have faith and do not doubt..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἔχητε πίστιν καὶ μὴ διακριθῆτε
* _q1_: οὐ μόνον τὸ τῆς συκῆς ποιήσετε ἀλλὰ κἂν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ εἴπητε Ἄρθητι καὶ βλήθητι εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν γενήσεται


## Notes
The probability is debatable here. Jesus is speaking to his closest disciples, who presumably have faith, but Jesus has already rebuked the disciples for "small faith" and doubting on at least two occasions (14:31; 17:20). However, the time reference appears to be gnomic rather than restricted to the moment of speech, suggesting that this statement is applicable to all who have faith rather than just to the original disciples.


----------------

# Matt 21:21b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Promise


## English
p: (even if you say to this mountain, "Be taken up and thrown into the sea")
q: (it will happen)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "even if"
NIV: "also you can..." 
NLT: "You can even..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: κἂν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ εἴπητε Ἄρθητι καὶ βλήθητι εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν
* _q1_: γενήσεται


## Notes
Greek: καν (και + εαν) 'even if'
The conditional sentence of 21:21b is embedded into q of the conditional in 21:21a. Jesus is describing a very unusual scenario and is probably using hyperbole.


----------------

# Matt 21:22: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (If you believe)
q: (you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer) (NIV)


* ESV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NASB, NRSV: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: πιστεύοντες
* _q1_: πάντα ὅσα ἂν αἰτήσητε ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ … λήμψεσθε


## Notes
This is an implied conditional using the present participle of 'believe': "believing, you will receive" = "if you believe, you will receive".


----------------

# Matt 21:24: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you tell me the answer)
q: (then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NLT inverts p and q


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃν ἐὰν εἴπητέ μοι
* _q1_: κἀγὼ ὑμῖν ἐρῶ ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιῶ


----------------

# Matt 21:25: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if we say 'from heaven')
q: (he will say to us 'Why then, did you not believe him?')


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν εἴπωμεν Ἐξ οὐρανοῦ
* _q1_: ἐρεῖ ἡμῖν Διὰ τί οὖν οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ


## Notes
The conditionals in v.25 and v.26 should be understood as a pair; together they give the two possible answers to Jesus' question and the consequences of each.


----------------

# Matt 21:26: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if we say 'from man')
q: (we are afraid of the crowd - implies 'the crowd will attack us')


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ εἴπωμεν Ἐξ ἀνθρώπων
* _q1_: φοβούμεθα τὸν ὄχλον


## Notes
See note on 21:25. The parallel account in Luke 20:6 explains the fear more, as the Pharisees say they believe the people would stone them.


----------------

# Matt 22:24: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Command


## English
p: (if a man dies having no children)
q: (his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐάν τις ἀποθάνῃ μὴ ἔχων τέκνα
* _q1_: ἐπιγαμβρεύσει ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀναστήσει σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ


## Notes
This conditional is a sumary of Deutoronomy 25:5-6. The Saducees use this to begin a conversation about the topic of remarriage after a death, in order to challenge Jesus.


----------------

# Matt 22:45: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if then David calls him Lord)
q: (how is he his son?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν Δαυὶδ καλεῖ αὐτὸν κύριον
* _q1_: πῶς υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἐστιν


## Notes
This is factual because Jesus has just quoted Psa 110:1 where David calls the Christ "my Lord". Jesus' question here may not be rhetorical since v.46 states that "no one was able to answer him". Hagner notes that the point of the question is to "elevate the concept of Messiah from that of a special human being to one who uniquely manifests the presence of God."


----------------

# Matt 23:30: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if we had lived in the days of our fathers)
q: (we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἤμεθα ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν ἤμεθα αὐτῶν κοινωνοὶ ἐν τῷ αἵματι τῶν προφητῶν


## Notes
Here Jesus is quoting the kind of thing that the Pharisees would say.


----------------

# Matt 24:22: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (unless that time of calamity is shortened)
q: (not a single person will survive) (NLT)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "if... not"
NASB, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἐκολοβώθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι ἐκεῖναι
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν ἐσώθη πᾶσα σάρξ


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'if not', 'unless'
The time reference here may be confusing. Although the Greek has an aorist (past) verb, Jesus is talking about the future. This is confirmed because Jesus states directly afterward that "those days will be cut short." Because "those days" are still in the future, NLT has, "unless that time...is [i.e. will be] shortened." The ESV/NRSV/NIV translation of "had not been cut short" makes this into a past time conditional, which is not correct. One way to translate this is: "If those days are not [i.e. will not be] cut short, no one will survive."
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "Only if those days are [i.e. will be] cut short will any person (lit: flesh) be saved."


----------------

# Matt 24:23: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if anyone says to you "Look here is the Christ" or "there he is!")
q: (do not believe it)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: τότε ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ Ἰδοὺ ὧδε ὁ χριστός ἤ Ὧδε
* _q1_: μὴ πιστεύσητε


## Notes
Greek: εαν τις 'if anyone'
The probability is likely because Jesus states in the next verse that false christs will come (see also 24:4). This conditional describes what the disciples should do if or when they hear these false claims.


----------------

# Matt 24:26a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if they say to you "Look, he is in the wilderness")
q: (do not go out)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὖν εἴπωσιν ὑμῖν Ἰδοὺ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐστίν
* _q1_: μὴ ἐξέλθητε


## Notes
The two condiitonals in v.26 describe situations that might arise in which people may claim Christ has come when he has not. (For "if possible in v.24, see the Non-conditional section at the end of the page.)


----------------

# Matt 24:26b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
Square brackets show what is elided in the Greek text:
p: ([if they say] "Look, he is in the inner rooms")
q: (do not believe it"


* ESV, NRSV: include "if they say"
NASB, NIV, NLT: preserve the ellision


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἰδοὺ ἐν τοῖς ταμείοις
* _q1_: μὴ πιστεύσητε


## Notes
See note on 24:26a.
This conditional could be considered the same condtional with v24a having a more complex structure, but we favor treating it as its own conditional with an elided verb.


----------------

# Matt 24:43: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming)
q: (he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ᾔδει ὁ οἰκοδεσπότης ποίᾳ φυλακῇ ὁ κλέπτης ἔρχεται
* _q1_: ἐγρηγόρησεν ἂν καὶ οὐκ ἂν εἴασεν διορυχθῆναι τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ


## Notes
The sentence is referring to a past time situation, but it should be understood as being applied metaphorically to the return of Christ, which can occur at any time (see v.44).


----------------

# Matt 24:48-51: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if that wicked servant says to himself 'My master is delayed', and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eats and drinks with drunkards)
q: (the master of the servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know and will cut him in pieces with the hypocrites.)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ ὁ κακὸς δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ Χρονίζει μου ὁ κύριος καὶ ἄρξηται τύπτειν τοὺς συνδούλους αὐτοῦ ἐσθίῃ δὲ καὶ πίνῃ μετὰ τῶν μεθυόντων
* _q1_: ἥξει ὁ κύριος τοῦ δούλου ἐκείνου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει


## Notes
P is v.48-49 and q is v.50-51.


----------------

# Matt 26:15: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Question


## English
q: (What will you give me)
p: (if I deliver him over to you)?


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NASB, NLT: "to" infinitive


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Τί θέλετέ μοι δοῦναι
* _p1_: κἀγὼ ὑμῖν παραδώσω αὐτόν


## Notes
This is an implied conditional. The Greek says, "What are you willing to give me, and I will hand him over to you?" This is either translated in English as a conditional, or with an infinitive of purpose: "What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?" (NASB)


----------------

# Matt 26:24: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Warn


## English
q: (it would have been better for him)
p: (if he had not been born)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV: "to" infinitive


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καλὸν ἦν αὐτῷ
* _p1_: εἰ οὐκ ἐγεννήθη ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος


----------------

# Matt 26:33: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (though/even if they all fall away because of you)
q: (I will never fall away)


* ESV, NRSV: "though"
NASB: "even though"
NIV, NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ πάντες σκανδαλισθήσονται ἐν σοί
* _q1_: ἐγὼ οὐδέποτε σκανδαλισθήσομαι


## Notes
While Mark represents this phrase grammatically as a concessive conditional (ει και), Matthew simply has ει. However, this verse seems to carry the same force of a concessive conditional.
The reality of this proposition is a bit complicated. In the preceding verses, Jesus has just stated that all will indeed fall away, including Peter. This conditional has Peter asserting that he will not fall away even if/though the others will.


----------------

# Matt 26:35: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (even if I must die with you)
q: (I will not deny you)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "even if"
NRSV: "even though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Κἂν δέῃ με σὺν σοὶ ἀποθανεῖν
* _q1_: οὐ μή σε ἀπαρνήσομαι


## Notes
Greek: καν
The use of this concessive conditional indicates that Peter considered dying with Jesus to be an extreme situation, and so we have indicated the probability (from Peter's perspective) as very unlikely.


----------------

# Matt 26:42a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if this cannot pass unless I drink it)
q: (your will be done)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὐ δύναται τοῦτο παρελθεῖν ἐὰν μὴ αὐτὸ πίω
* _q1_: γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου


## Notes
There is a general consensus among the commentaries (Hagner, Osbourne, and Morris) that the shift in the conditional to a negative exemplifies Jesus’ recognition that it is indeed the Father’s will for him to go to the cross. Furthermore, q is something that Jesus has acknowledged he wants, whatever the case in p; q is not directly dependent on p, but is simply relevant to it. See note on 26:42b.

# Matt 26:42b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (this cannot pass)
p: (unless I drink it)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: αὐτὸ πίω
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ αὐτὸ πίω


## Notes
εαν μη 'if not', 'unless' 
Embedded within p in v.42a is another conditional. The entire conditional of 42b makes up p for 42a.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "(My father, if) this cup can be taken away only if I drink it, (your will be done)."


----------------

# Matt 27:40: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Mock


## English
p: (if you are the Son of God)
q: (come down from the cross)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ θεοῦ
* _q1_: κατάβηθι ἀπὸ τοῦ σταυροῦ


## Notes
Though Jesus was indeed the Christ, in the minds of the speakers, they consider Jesus' supposed inability to save himself as proof he is certainly not the Christ. The speakers are presenting p as "true for the sake of argument" in order to mock Jesus. Parallel accounts (in Mark particularly) make it clear that this was the attitude.


----------------

# Matt 27:43: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Mock


## English
q: (let God deliver him now)
p: (if he desires him)


* ESV, NIV, NLT: "if he desires/wants him"
NASB: "if he delights in him"
NRSV: "if he wants to"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ῥυσάσθω νῦν
* _p1_: εἰ θέλει αὐτόν


## Notes
See note at 27:40. In the speakers' minds, God would not allow this injustice to occur if Jesus were really sent by him. Osbourne notes the irony that the mockings of Jesus come true in ways the speakers did not expect, as God does indeed "desire" Jesus and so raises him from the dead.


----------------

# Matt 28:14: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if this comes to the governor's ears)
q: (we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀκουσθῇ τοῦτο ἐπὶ τοῦ ἡγεμόνος
* _q1_: ἡμεῖς πείσομεν αὐτὸν καὶ ὑμᾶς ἀμερίμνους ποιήσομεν


----------------

# Mark 1:40: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (If you will) 
q: (you can make me clean)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν θέλῃς
* _q1_: δύνασαί με καθαρίσαι


## Notes
It seems that p could be merely a politeness strategy to make a request. However, the consensus of the commentaries is that while the leper is expressing faith in Jesus's ability, he is expressing doubt as to his willingness.


----------------

# Mark 2:21: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (If he does) 
q: (the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made)


* ESV: "if he does"
NASB, NRSV, NIV: "otherwise"
NLT: "for"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή
* _q1_: αἴρει τὸ πλήρωμα ἀπ αὐτοῦ τὸ καινὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ καὶ χεῖρον σχίσμα γίνεται


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή with an elided (understood) verb. Translator's Notes states that this phrase introduces a hypothetical situation in which someone does what is described in the last clause, making this is genuine conditional (as in ESV), although teh verb is elided in Greek.


----------------

# Mark 2:22: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (If he does) 
q: (the wine will burst the skins—and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins)


* ESV: "if he does"
NASB, NRSV, NIV: "otherwise"
NLT: "for"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή
* _q1_: ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή with an elided (understood) verb. See note on 2:21.


----------------

# Mark 3:24: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if a kingdom is divided against itself)
q: (that kingdom cannot stand)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν βασιλεία ἐφ ἑαυτὴν μερισθῇ
* _q1_: οὐ δύναται σταθῆναι ἡ βασιλεία ἐκείνη


----------------

# Mark 3:25: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if a house is divided against itself)
q: (that house will not be able to stand)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οἰκία ἐφ ἑαυτὴν μερισθῇ
* _q1_: οὐ δυνήσεται ἡ οἰκία ἐκείνη σταθῆναι


----------------

# Mark 3:26: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided)
q: (he cannot stand, but is coming to an end)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὁ Σατανᾶς ἀνέστη ἐφ ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἐμερίσθη
* _q1_: οὐ δύναται στῆναι ἀλλὰ τέλος ἔχει


## Notes
Boyer (1981: 85) and Elliott (1981:206) cite this verse as class 1 whereas Guelich (1989) argues it is class 2 based on the fact that, given the previous two hypothetical examples, this situation must not be the case (and class 2 conditionals are non-factual).


----------------

# Mark 3:27: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods)
p: (unless he first binds the strong man)


* ESV, NASB: "unless"
NRSV, NIV: "without"
NLT: untranslated ("only")


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καὶ τότε τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ διαρπάσει
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ πρῶτον τὸν ἰσχυρὸν δήσῃ


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'unless'.
Here Jesus is claiming that He has already bound Satan, but he does so using figurative language as is vs.24-25.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "A person can only enter the strong man's house and plunder/steal his property if he first binds the strong man."


----------------

# Mark 4:23: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (If anyone has ears to hear,)
q: (let him hear.)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "if"
NRSV, NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἔχει ὦτα ἀκούειν
* _q1_: ἀκουέτω


## Notes
This seems to have the same meaning as the more common "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." (See for example 4:9.)


----------------

# Mark 5:28: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Not applicable


## English
p: (If I touch even his garments) 
q: (I will be made well)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν ἅψωμαι κἂν τῶν ἱματίων αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: σωθήσομαι


## Notes
The illocutionary force category is not applicable here as the woman is speaking only to herself (which is Matthew's way of describing her thoughts).


----------------

# Mark 7:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat) 
p: (unless they wash their hands properly, holding to the tradition of the elders)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "unless"
NLT: "until"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐκ ἐσθίουσιν
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ πυγμῇ νίψωνται τὰς χεῖρας


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'unless'
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "For the Pharisees and all the Jews eat only if they carefully wash their hands, thus observing the traditions of the elders." Or: "Before they eat, they always wash their hands carefully."


----------------

# Mark 7:4: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (unless they wash)
q: (they do not eat)
(p and q match the order of the Greek)


* All English translations reverse the Greek order of p and q, thus matching 7:3.
ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "unless"
NLT: "until"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ βαπτίσωνται
* _q1_: οὐκ ἐσθίουσιν


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "they eat only if they wash themselves." Or: "they always wash themselves before they eat."


----------------

# Mark 7:11-12: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban” (that is, given to God) )
q: (then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "if... then" (vv 11-12)
NASB: "if"
NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν εἴπῃ ἄνθρωπος τῷ πατρὶ ἢ τῇ μητρί Κορβᾶν ὅ ἐστιν Δῶρον ὃ ἐὰν ἐξ ἐμοῦ ὠφεληθῇς
* _q1_: οὐκέτι ἀφίετε αὐτὸν οὐδὲν ποιῆσαι τῷ πατρὶ ἢ τῇ μητρί


## Notes
Within p there is an additional ἐὰν meaning "whatever"; see 7:11b in the non-conditionals section.


----------------

# Mark 8:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I send them away hungry to their homes) 
q: (they will faint on the way)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀπολύσω αὐτοὺς νήστεις εἰς οἶκον αὐτῶν
* _q1_: ἐκλυθήσονται ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ


----------------

# Mark 8:34: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (If anyone would come after me) 
q: (let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me)


* "ESV, NASB: ""if anyone""
NRSV, NLT: "if any (of you)"
NIV: "whoever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις θέλει ὀπίσω μου
* _q1_: ἀπαρνησάσθω ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἀράτω τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀκολουθείτω μοι


## Notes
Greek ἐἴ τις 'if anyone' 
This probability is analyzed as likely because the crowd actually is there following Jesus.


----------------

# Mark 9:22: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you can do anything)
q: (have compassion on us and help us)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NLT: p and q are reversed


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τι δύνῃ
* _q1_: βοήθησον ἡμῖν σπλαγχνισθεὶς ἐφ ἡμᾶς


## Notes
Greek: εἴ τι. Even though in Mark 8:23 this construction was obviously non-conditional, here it most certainly is. Additionally, its function is certainly not that ascribed to class 1 conditionals by exegetes; here it expresses great doubt: "The problem is so severe that the father is not at all confident that Jesus, despite his remarkable reputation, can do anything to help" (Evans 2001: 52. See also Lane 1974: 333; France 2002: 367; Cole 1989: 220).


----------------

# Mark 9:23: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Not applicable
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if you can)
q: missing


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Τὸ Εἰ δύνῃ


## Notes
Jesus is echoing the father's words in v.22 (NLT makes this clear: "What do you mean, 'If I can'?") He does this to draw attention to the father's doubt. This can be translated in the same way as the previous verse but marked in some way to show that it is a quotation.


----------------

# Mark 9:35: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if anyone would be first)
q: (he must be last of all and servant of all)


* NASB, NRSV, ESV: "if anyone"
NIV: "anyone"
NLT: "whoever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις θέλει πρῶτος εἶναι
* _q1_: ἔσται πάντων ἔσχατος καὶ πάντων διάκονος


## Notes
Greek: εἴ τις 'if anyone'
Here, even though we know that the disciples were just arguing about which of them was the greatest, Jesus presents this as a hypothetical situation, possibly to make the rebuke less direct.


----------------

# Mark 9:42: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Warn


## English
q: (it would be better for him)
p: (if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea)


* ESV, NSAB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: no conditional, "to" infinitive


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καλόν ἐστιν αὐτῷ μᾶλλον
* _p1_: εἰ περίκειται μύλος ὀνικὸς περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ βέβληται εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν


## Notes
The unlikely situation of someone having a heavy milstone hung around their neck and being thrown into a sea or lake communicates just how terrible is the fate of someone who casues a "little one" to stumble.


----------------

# Mark 9:43: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Exhort


## English
p: (if your hand causes you to sin)
q: (cut it off)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν σκανδαλίζῃ σε ἡ χείρ σου
* _q1_: ἀπόκοψον αὐτήν


## Notes
Jesus is warning and exhorting His listeners to take their sin seriously and deal with it earnestly; he is likely not implying that sin is something rare or unusual. Therefore, the probability of p being true is rated Very Likely.


----------------

# Mark 9:45: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Exhort


## English
p: (if your foot causes you to sin) 
q; (cut it off)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ὁ πούς σου σκανδαλίζῃ σε
* _q1_: ἀπόκοψον αὐτόν


## Notes
See note on 9:43.


----------------

# Mark 9:47: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Exhort


## English
p: (if your eye causes you to sin)
q: (tear it out)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζῃ σε
* _q1_: ἔκβαλε αὐτόν


## Notes
See note on 9:43.


----------------

# Mark 9:50: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if the salt has lost its saltiness)
q: (how will you make it salty again)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ τὸ ἅλας ἄναλον γένηται
* _q1_: ἐν τίνι αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε


## Notes
This conditional must be read in its context of describing discipleship. The connection between salt and discipleship is that, as Marshall (1978) puts it, "a false form of discipleship may look like salt, but the gradual process of leeching leaves only a zestless pile of waste.


----------------

# Mark 10:12: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
Modified from ESV to show Greek syntactic structure:
p: (if she {having divorced her husband} marries another)
q: (she commits adultery)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν αὐτὴ ἀπολύσασα τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς γαμήσῃ ἄλλον
* _q1_: μοιχᾶται


## Notes
The grammatically main verbs are "marry" and "commit adultery" with the part about divorce in a participial clause.


----------------

# Mark 11:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’)
q: (say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ Τί ποιεῖτε τοῦτο
* _q1_: εἴπατε Ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει καὶ εὐθὺς αὐτὸν ἀποστέλλει πάλιν ὧδε


## Notes
Greek: εαν τις 'if anyone'


----------------

# Mark 11:25: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
q: (forgive)
p: (if you have anything against anyone)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἀφίετε
* _p1_: εἴ τι ἔχετε κατά τινος


----------------

# Mark 11:31: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if we say, ‘From heaven’) 
q: (he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?')


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν εἴπωμεν Ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐρεῖ
* _q1_: ἐρεῖ Διὰ τί οὖν οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ


## Notes
The alternative response "From men" in v.32 has no conditional (unlike the parallel passages in Mat 21:26 and Luke 20:6). NIV interprets this as an understood conditional with p but no q.


----------------

# Mark 12:19: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Command


## English
p: (if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child)
q: (the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τινος ἀδελφὸς ἀποθάνῃ καὶ καταλίπῃ γυναῖκα καὶ μὴ ἀφῇ τέκνον
* _q1_: ἵνα λάβῃ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ ἐξαναστήσῃ σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ


## Notes
This conditional is a sumary of Deutoronomy 25:5-6. The Saducees use this to begin a conversation about the topic of remarriage after a death, in order to challenge Jesus.


----------------

# Mark 13:20: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Warn


## English
p: (if the Lord had not [decided to] cut short the days)
q: (no flesh [i.e. human being] would be saved)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "if...not"
NASB, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἐκολόβωσεν κύριος τὰς ἡμέρας
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν ἐσώθη πᾶσα σάρξ


## Notes
εἰ μὴ 'if not', 'unless'
Although the events of this verse are in future time, the Greek switches from future tense to aorist in this verse (see France 2002: 527 for comments on the use of the aorist here). Many English translations reflect this tense change and use "had not cut short". Because "those days" are still in the future, this should be understood as "had not decided to cut short." This gives a non-factual interpretation: "If the Lord had not decided to cut short those days (but he did), no one would survive." This is confirmed because the parallel passage in Mat 24:22 states directly afterward that "those days will be cut short." Although the double negative makes it confusing this is a non-factual conditional. 
If this is paraphrased to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except', this should be expressed as a future event: "Only if the Lord shortens [i.e. will shorten] those days will any person (lit: flesh) be saved."


----------------

# Mark 13:21: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Look, there he is!’) 
q: (do not believe it)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if anyone"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ Ἴδε ὧδε ὁ χριστός Ἴδε ἐκεῖ
* _q1_: μὴ πιστεύετε


## Notes
Greek: εαν τις 'if anyone'
This probability is very likely because Jesus states in the next verse that false messiahs will come (see also 13:6). This conditional describes what the disciples should do if or when they hear these false claims.


----------------

# Mark 14:21: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Warn


## English
q: (It would have been better for that man)
p: (if he had not been born)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV: no conditional, "to" infinitive


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καλὸν αὐτῷ
* _p1_: εἰ οὐκ ἐγεννήθη ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος


## Notes
This example is complex because it is comparison between a present reality and a hypothetical situation that has obviously not taken place. See Translator's Notes. 
The verb in q (translated "would have been") is missing here but is present in the parallel in Mat 26:24 and in some textual variants. Bratcher & Nida (1961: 438) state it is not original but should be supplied.


----------------

# Mark 14:29: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
NIV:
p: (even if all fall away)
q: (I will not)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "even though"
NIV, NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ καὶ πάντες σκανδαλισθήσονται
* _q1_: ἀλλ οὐκ ἐγώ


## Notes
Greek Εἰ καὶ 'even if'; this is a "concessive conditional."
It is hard to determine how likely Peter thought the other disciples were to fall away, but Edwards suggests that he saw it as somewhat likely: "Peter is not surprised at the thought of the defection of the other disciples. Perhaps he even expects it of them" (2002: 429). Cole (1989: 301) agrees.


----------------

# Mark 14:31: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (If I must die with you) 
q: (I will not deny you)


* ESV: "if"
NASB, NIV, NLT: "even if"
NRSV: "even though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν δέῃ με συναποθανεῖν σοι
* _q1_: οὐ μή σε ἀπαρνήσομαι


## Notes
Greek Ἐὰν 'if' but understood as a "concessive conditional" in most translations.
It is difficult to determine how likely Peter thought it was that he would have to die with Jesus. When the time came, he broke his promise and denied Jesus, but that does not negate what was in Peter's mind at the time he made this promise.


----------------

# Mark 16:18: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if they drink any deadly poison)
q: (it will not hurt them)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "and if"
NIV: "and when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: κἂν θανάσιμόν τι πίωσιν
* _q1_: οὐ μὴ αὐτοὺς βλάψῃ


## Notes
Greek κἂν often expresses a concessive meaning ('even if') but here it seems to simply mean "and if".
Given the context that this is part of a list of of signs that Jesus says "will accompony those who believe", this situation has been classified as very likely. rather than neutral probability

# Luke 4:3: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you are the Son of God)
q: (command this stone to become bread)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ θεοῦ
* _q1_: εἰπὲ τῷ λίθῳ τούτῳ ἵνα γένηται ἄρτος


## Notes
Nolland notes that the devil (and Jesus) had no doubt about his identity as Son of God (see also note at Matthew 4:3). The Translator's Notes acknowledge that some scholars believe p is an expression of doubt, but we have interpretated this as a factual condition.


----------------

# Luke 4:7: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise / Exhort


## English
p: (if you then will worship me)
q: (it will all be yours)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: σὺ οὖν ἐὰν προσκυνήσῃς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ
* _q1_: ἔσται σοῦ πᾶσα


## Notes
In 4:3 and 4:9 the exhortations (or temptations) are direct and occur in q; in this verse the exhortation (or temptation) is made indirectly in p. This must have been a true temptation, as the devlil believed that there was a possibility, however small, that Jesus would give in to the temptation.


----------------

# Luke 4:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you are the Son of God)
q: (throw yourself down from here)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ θεοῦ
* _q1_: βάλε σεαυτὸν ἐντεῦθεν κάτω


## Notes
Again, we may assume the devil is fully aware that Jesus is the Son of God, but merely wishes to manipulate and tempt him by suggesting he prove it.


----------------

# Luke 5:12: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you will)
q: (you can make me clean)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν θέλῃς
* _q1_: δύνασαί με καθαρίσαι


## Notes
Marshall considers the conditional here a mark of politeness, but it could also be expressing genuine doubt about Jesus' willingness to heal.


----------------

# Luke 5:36b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if he does)
q: (he willl tear the new and the piece from the new will not match the old)


* NASB, NRSV, NIV: "otherwise"
ESV: "if he does"
NLT: "for then"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ
* _q1_: καὶ τὸ καινὸν σχίσει καὶ τῷ παλαιῷ οὐ συμφωνήσει τὸ ἐπίβλημα τὸ ἀπὸ τοῦ καινοῦ


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή γε with an elided (understood) verb. English translations express the constrcution εἰ δὲ μή γε in a variety of ways; the ESV translation shows how it is related to a conditional meaning. This phrase presents the alternative to what was described in the previous clause: "No one tears a piece from a new garment and sews it on an old garment."


----------------

# Luke 5:37: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if he does)
q: (the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed)


* NASB, NRSV, NIV: "otherwise"
ESV: "if he does"
NLT: "for"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ
* _q1_: ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος ὁ νέος τοὺς ἀσκούς καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκχυθήσεται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοὶ ἀπολοῦνται


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή γε with an elided (understood) verb; see note at 5:36.


----------------

# Luke 6:32: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if you love those who love you)
q: (what benefit is that to you?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἀγαπῶντας ὑμᾶς
* _q1_: ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν


## Notes
This verse and the next two (vs.33-34) are a series of conditional statements posed as rhetorical questions. Jesus' point is that loving one's enemies and doing good when no return is expected amounts to something truly worth rewarding in the eyes of the Father. Here, Luke uses ει in v.32 and εαν in the next two verses, but there does not seem to be any difference in the level of probabilitiy. Note also that Matthew 5:46 uses εαν.


----------------

# Luke 6:33: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if you do good to those who do good to you)
q: (what benefit is that to you?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀγαθοποιῆτε τοὺς ἀγαθοποιοῦντας ὑμᾶς
* _q1_: ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν


## Notes
See note at 6:32.


----------------

# Luke 6:34: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive)
q: (what credit is that to you?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δανίσητε παρ ὧν ἐλπίζετε λαβεῖν
* _q1_: ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν


## Notes
See note at 6:32.


----------------

# Luke 7:39: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if this man were a prophet)
q: (he would have known who and what sort of woman this is, for she is a sinner)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Οὗτος εἰ ἦν προφήτης
* _q1_: ἐγίνωσκεν ἂν τίς καὶ ποταπὴ ἡ γυνὴ ἥτις ἅπτεται αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν


## Notes
While in truth, Jesus is a prophet and does know who the woman is, in the mind of the Pharisee he does not, and so the condition is non-factual for the speaker.


----------------

# Luke 9:13: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (we have no more than five loaves and two fish)
p: (unless we are to go and buy food for all these people)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "unless"
NLT: "Or are you expecting...?"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Οὐκ εἰσὶν ἡμῖν πλεῖον ἢ ἄρτοι πέντε καὶ ἰχθύες δύο
* _p1_: εἰ μήτι πορευθέντες ἡμεῖς ἀγοράσωμεν εἰς πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον βρώματα


## Notes
Greek: ει μητι; Boyer notes that the μητι here is typically an interrogative particle in questions that expect a negative answer. This is likely why a subjunctive verb is used with ει here; it describes an event that is unlikely to occur.
The disciples make the observation in  q "We have no more than five loaves and two fish" in order to object to Jesus' instruction to feed the crowd. The disciples do not really believe that Jesus expects them to go and buy food (in fact, the parallel passage in Mark notes how beyond their means even a low estimate of the cost would be). 
The NLT offers an alternative to using 'unless': “But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered. “Or are you expecting us to go and buy enough food for this whole crowd?” (This also easily fits with Nolland's assessment that this statement from the disciples "could easily be read as sarcasm".) Rephrasing this as, "We will have more than five loaves and two fish only if we go and buy food for all these people" would completely miss the point and is not an acceptable translation.


----------------

# Luke 9:23: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if anyone would come after me)
q: (let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me)


* NASB, ESV, RSV, NLT: "if"
NIV: "whoever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις θέλει ὀπίσω μου ἔρχεσθαι
* _q1_: ἀρνησάσθω ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἀράτω τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καθ ἡμέραν καὶ ἀκολουθείτω μοι


## Notes
Jesus is speaking to disciples, so the likelihood that they wish to follow him is high.


----------------

# Luke 10:6a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if a son of peace is there)
q: (your peace will rest on him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ᾖ ἐκεῖ υἱὸς εἰρήνης
* _q1_: ἐπαναπαήσεται ἐπ αὐτὸν ἡ εἰρήνη ὑμῶν


## Notes
Jesus compares two different types of people, but unlike 9:48 and other similar verses, he uses a regular 3rd class conditional paired with construction εἰ δὲ μή γε in v.6b.


----------------

# Luke 10:6b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if not) [i.e. if there is not a son of peace there]
q: (your peace will return to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ
* _q1_: ἐφ ὑμᾶς ἀνακάμψει


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή γε with an elided (understood) verb; see note at 5:36 for discussion of this construction. Mathew 10:13b has a 3rd class conditional here instead of the compressed negative construction.


----------------

# Luke 10:13: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon)
q: (they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if...they would have..."
NLT: "if...their people would have..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγενήθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν
* _q1_: πάλαι ἂν ἐν σάκκῳ καὶ σποδῷ καθήμενοι μετενόησαν


## Notes
Jesus' miracles were not done in Tyre and Sidon, but he predicts how the people of those towns would have acted in that case. Garland notes that the suggestion that notorious sinful cities would have repented seems quite improbable. This, however, communicates just how serious the situaiton is.


----------------

# Luke 11:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend)
q: (yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs)


* ESV, NLT: "though"
NASB, NRSV, NIV: "even though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ οὐ δώσει αὐτῷ ἀναστὰς διὰ τὸ εἶναι φίλον αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: διά γε τὴν ἀναίδειαν αὐτοῦ ἐγερθεὶς δώσει αὐτῷ ὅσων χρῄζει


## Notes
Greek: ει και; this is a "concessive conditional." Because p is factual, most English translations use 'though' or 'even though' rather than 'even if'.


----------------

# Luke 11:11: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
What father
p: (if his son ask for a fish)
q: (will give him a snake)?


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NASB: "suppose"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς ἰχθύν
* _q1_: καὶ ἀντὶ ἰχθύος ὄφιν αὐτῷ ἐπιδώσει


## Notes
Although there is no conditional marker in the Greek, the sense here is clearly conditional. Jesus is asking his hearers to consider a hypothetical but commonplace scenario (a child asking for food) and an almost unthinkable response (a father giving the child something poisonous). Almost all English translations translate these verses as conditional sentences. The probability "likely" refers to the probability of p, not the probability of q (which is very unlikely to happen).


----------------

# Luke 11:12: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: or (if his son ask for an egg)
q: (will give him a scorpion)?


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: αἰτήσει ᾠόν
* _q1_: ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ σκορπίον


## Notes
See note at 11:11.


----------------

# Luke 11:13: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
Note: in UBS Greek text, q is not a rhetorical question but rather a statement
p: (if you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children)
q: (how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν ὑμεῖς πονηροὶ ὑπάρχοντες οἴδατε δόματα ἀγαθὰ διδόναι τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν
* _q1_: πόσῳ μᾶλλον ὁ πατὴρ ὁ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ δώσει πνεῦμα ἅγιον τοῖς αἰτοῦσιν αὐτόν


## Notes
In verses 11 and 12 Jesus has just shown how human fathers give good things to their children, so this is a factual condition. The phrase "being evil" occurs within p; in some languages it may be best to rephrase p as a statement: "Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more, therefore will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?"


----------------

# Luke 11:18: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if Satan also is divided against himself)
q: (how will his kingdom stand?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ καὶ ὁ Σατανᾶς ἐφ ἑαυτὸν διεμερίσθη
* _q1_: πῶς σταθήσεται ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ


## Notes
P describes a false situation which Jesus presents as possible for the sake of argument in order to show that q is ridiculous (also in the following verse).


----------------

# Luke 11:19: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (and if I cast out demons by Beelzebul)
q: (by whom do your sons cast them out?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἐγὼ ἐν Βεελζεβοὺλ ἐκβάλλω τὰ δαιμόνια
* _q1_: οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἐν τίνι ἐκβάλλουσιν


## Notes
See v.18.


----------------

# Luke 11:20: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (but if I cast out demons by the finger of God)
q: (then the kingdom of God has come upon you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἐν δακτύλῳ θεοῦ ἐκβάλλω τὰ δαιμόνια
* _q1_: ἄρα ἔφθασεν ἐφ ὑμᾶς ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ


## Notes
P is factual, though Jesus' audience may not yet be convinced of it.


----------------

# Luke 11:36: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if then your whole body is full of light, having no dark part)
q: (it will be wholly bright)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν τὸ σῶμά σου ὅλον φωτεινόν μὴ ἔχον μέρος τι σκοτεινόν
* _q1_: ἔσται φωτεινὸν ὅλον


----------------

# Luke 12:26: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if then you are not able to do as small a thing as that)
q: (why are you anxious about the rest?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "if"
NIV: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν οὐδὲ ἐλάχιστον δύνασθε
* _q1_: τί περὶ τῶν λοιπῶν μεριμνᾶτε


----------------

# Luke 12:28: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue / Encourage


## English
p: (if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven)
q: (how much more will he clothe you, oh you of little faith!)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἐν ἀγρῷ τὸν χόρτον ὄντα σήμερον καὶ αὔριον εἰς κλίβανον βαλλόμενον ὁ θεὸς οὕτως ἀμφιέζει
* _q1_: πόσῳ μᾶλλον ὑμᾶς ὀλιγόπιστοι


## Notes
Jesus is using a widely known fact in p to argue for the point he makes in q, that God will indeed take care to clothe his people.


----------------

# Luke 12:38: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
ESV with modifications in brackets to reflect the Greek structure:
p: ([even] if he comes in the second watch, [even if] he comes in the third watch and finds them awake)
q: (blessed are those servants)


* ESV, NRSV: "if"
NASB: "whether... or even"
NIV: "even if"
NLT: untranslated ("may")


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: κἂν ἐν τῇ δευτέρᾳ κἂν ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ φυλακῇ ἔλθῃ καὶ εὕρῃ οὕτως
* _q1_: μακάριοί εἰσιν ἐκεῖνοι


## Notes
Greek: καν...καν...; q is not dependent on when the master returns (the second watch is the mniddle of the night, the third watch is just before dawn). Rather, q is dependent on the master finding the servants awake and alert at whatever time he arrives.


----------------

# Luke 12:39: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming)
q: (he would not have left his house to be broken into)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ᾔδει ὁ οἰκοδεσπότης ποίᾳ ὥρᾳ ὁ κλέπτης ἔρχεται
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν ἀφῆκεν διορυχθῆναι τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ


## Notes
The sentence is referring to a past time situation, but it should be understood as being applied metaphorically to the return of Christ, which can occur at any time (see v.40).


----------------

# Luke 12:45-46: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (but if that servant says, "my master is delayed in coming", and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk)
q: (the master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "if"
NIV: "suppose"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ ὁ δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ Χρονίζει ὁ κύριός μου ἔρχεσθαι καὶ ἄρξηται τύπτειν τοὺς παῖδας καὶ τὰς παιδίσκας ἐσθίειν τε καὶ πίνειν καὶ μεθύσκεσθαι
* _q1_: ἥξει ὁ κύριος τοῦ δούλου ἐκείνου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει καὶ διχοτομήσει αὐτὸν καὶ τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀπίστων θήσει


## Notes
P makes up v.45, while q makes up v.46.


----------------

# Luke 13:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if you do not repent)
q: (you will all likewise perish)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"
(NLT inverts p and q)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ μετανοῆτε
* _q1_: πάντες ὁμοίως ἀπολεῖσθε


## Notes
Jesus is speaking to a general crowd here, so the probability of p is uncertain. 
These two (almost) identical sentences (13:3 and 13:5) have the regular order p>q and q is affirmative. If your language has no equivalent of 'unless', just follow the Greek: "If you(pl) do not repent, you will all perish too."


----------------

# Luke 13:5: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if you do not repent)
q: (you will all likewise perish)


* NASB, ESV, RSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ μετανοῆτε
* _q1_: πάντες ὡσαύτως ἀπολεῖσθε


## Notes
See note at 13:3.


----------------

# Luke 13:9a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Warn


## English
Note: q is elided in the Greek
p: (if it should bear fruit next year)
q: [elided]


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: κἂν μὲν ποιήσῃ καρπὸν εἰς τὸ μέλλον


## Notes
Greek: καν 'even if'. 
The five English translations treat this as a conditional and supply q ("fine" or "well and good"). Alternatively the Translator's Referene Transaltion suggests: "Maybe it will produce fruit next year."


----------------

# Luke 13:9b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Warn


## English
Clarification in brackets
p: (if not) [if it does not bear fruit]
q: (you can cut it down)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ
* _q1_: ἐκκόψεις αὐτήν


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή γε with an elided (understood) verb. See note at 5:36 for discussion of this construction and note at 13:9b for context.


----------------

# Luke 14:5: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
ESV:
p: (Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day
q: (will not immediately pull him out?)
NIV:
p: (If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day
q: (will you not immediately pull it out?)


* ESV: gerund "having"
NASB: future "will have"
NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Τίνος ὑμῶν υἱὸς ἢ βοῦς εἰς φρέαρ πεσεῖται
* _q1_: καὶ οὐκ εὐθέως ἀνασπάσει αὐτὸν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ σαββάτου


## Notes
This is an implied conditional in Greek; the main verb in the protasis is missing. The phrase "on the Sabbath" is part of the apodosis in the Greek text.


----------------

# Luke 14:26: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes even his own life)
q: (he cannot be my disciple)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV: "whoever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρός με καὶ οὐ μισεῖ τὸν πατέρα ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς καὶ τὰς ἀδελφάς ἔτι τε καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἑαυτοῦ
* _q1_: οὐ δύναται εἶναί μου μαθητής


## Notes
Jesus uses hyperbolic language in a conditional to introduce his discussion of the need to understand the cost of being a disciple.


----------------

# Luke 14:32: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
Clarification in brackets
p: (if not) [if the king is not able to afford going to battle]
q: (while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if...not"
NASB: "or else"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ
* _q1_: ἔτι αὐτοῦ πόρρω ὄντος πρεσβείαν ἀποστείλας ἐρωτᾷ τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή γε with an elided (understood) verb. See note at 5:36 for discussion of this construction.


----------------

# Luke 14:34: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely

* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if salt has lost its taste)
q: (how shall its saltiness be restored?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ καὶ τὸ ἅλας μωρανθῇ
* _q1_: ἐν τίνι ἀρτυθήσεται


## Notes
This conditional must be read in its context of describing discipleship. The connection between salt and discipleship is that, as Marshall (1978) puts it, "a false form of discipleship may look like salt, but the gradual process of leeching leaves only a zestless pile of waste."

p: (if she loses a coin)
q: ([what woman] does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: "suppose"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀπολέσῃ δραχμὴν μίαν
* _q1_: οὐχὶ ἅπτει λύχνον καὶ σαροῖ τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ ζητεῖ ἐπιμελῶς ἕως οὗ εὕρῃ


## Notes
This conditional introduces the parable of the woman with the lost coin. While Jesus is asserting a fact about a relatable situation, he is using the parable to teach about sinners repenting.

# Luke 16:11: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if then you have not been faithful with unrighteous wealth)
q: (who will entrust to you the true riches?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν ἐν τῷ ἀδίκῳ μαμωνᾷ πιστοὶ οὐκ ἐγένεσθε
* _q1_: τὸ ἀληθινὸν τίς ὑμῖν πιστεύσει


----------------

# Luke 16:12: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if you have not been faithful with that which is another's)
q: (who will give you that which is your own?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐν τῷ ἀλλοτρίῳ πιστοὶ οὐκ ἐγένεσθε
* _q1_: τὸ ὑμέτερον τίς δώσει ὑμῖν


----------------

# Luke 16:30: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if someone goes to them from the dead)
q: (they will repent)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἀπὸ νεκρῶν πορευθῇ πρὸς αὐτοὺς
* _q1_: μετανοήσουσιν


## Notes
The rich man seemed convinced that a visit from the dead would convince his family members of God's truth. He would likely not have made the suggestion if he did not believe it possible or even likely.


----------------

# Luke 16:31a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if they do not hear Moses and the prophets)
q: (neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ Μωϋσέως καὶ τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἀκούουσιν
* _q1_: οὐδ ἐάν τις ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ πεισθήσονται


## Notes
P is factual because the rich man's relatives are not listening to the Law and Prophets. Q itself consists of a conditional sentence.


----------------

# Luke 16:31b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
Order modified to reflect the Greek
p: ([neither] if someone should rise from the dead)
q: (will they be convinced)


* ESV: "if"
NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ
* _q1_: πεισθήσονται


## Notes
This conditional makes up the q of v.31a. Although Greek just has ἐάν 'if', p is so unlikely (from the perspective of the characters in teh story) that most English translations treat this as a concessive conditional and use "even if". Most English translations also reverse the order and put q before p.


----------------

# Luke 17:2: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Warn


## English
q: (it would be better for him)
p: (if a milstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: λυσιτελεῖ αὐτῷ
* _p1_: εἰ λίθος μυλικὸς περίκειται περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρριπται εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν


## Notes
The unlikely situation of someone having a heavy milstone hung around their neck and being thrown into a sea or lake communicates just how terrible is the fate of someone who casues a "little one" to stumble.


----------------

# Luke 17:3a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if your brother sins)
q: (rebuke him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἁμάρτῃ ὁ ἀδελφός σου
* _q1_: ἐπιτίμησον αὐτῷ


## Notes
The second person pronouns ('your', 'you') and the verbs 'rebuke' and 'forgive' in vs.3-4 are all singular; Jesus is addressing each of his discples individually.


----------------

# Luke 17:3b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if he repents)
q: (forgive him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NIV, NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μετανοήσῃ
* _q1_: ἄφες αὐτῷ


----------------

# Luke 17:4: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if he sins against you seven times in the day and turns to you seven times, saying, "I repent")
q: (you must forgive him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἑπτάκις τῆς ἡμέρας ἁμαρτήσῃ εἰς σὲ καὶ ἑπτάκις ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς σὲ λέγων Μετανοῶ
* _q1_: ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ


## Notes
Although the form of the conditional here is the same as in v.3 (ἐὰν 'if), v.4 describes a more unlikely event, and so the NIV and NLT translate it here as a concessive conditional 'even if'. The command to forgive has the same verb as in v.3b but the form of the verb is different; ESV, NRSV, NIV, and NLT all translate this as "you must forgive".


----------------

# Luke 17:6: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
Modified to better reflect the verb tense/aspect of the Greek
p: (if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed)
q: (you could have been saying to the mulberry tree, "..." and it would have obeyed you.)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἔχετε πίστιν ὡς κόκκον σινάπεως
* _q1_: ἐλέγετε ἂν τῇ συκαμίνῳ ταύτῃ Ἐκριζώθητι καὶ φυτεύθητι ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ καὶ ὑπήκουσεν ἂν ὑμῖν


## Notes
This ia mixed conditional: p has εἰ μὴ plus an indicative present verb, typical of class 1; q has ἂν which is typical of class 2. Boyer suggests that αν is being used with an alternative meaning, something like "could".
The probability is debatable here. In the parallel passage in Matthew 17:20, Jesus describes the disciples as having "so little faith. However, the time reference appears to be gnomic rather than restricted to the moment of speech, suggesting that this statement is applicable to all who have faith rather than just to the original disciples. However, the context here is different, and Jesus seems to be teaching them that the dsiciples do not require an increase of faith, but rather that whatever faith they have is enough to produce great results.


----------------

# Luke 18:4-5: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (though I neither fear God nor respect man)
q: (yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice)


* ESV, NRSV: "though"
NIV, NASB: "even though"
NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ καὶ τὸν θεὸν οὐ φοβοῦμαι οὐδὲ ἄνθρωπον ἐντρέπομαι
* _q1_: διά γε τὸ παρέχειν μοι κόπον τὴν χήραν ταύτην ἐκδικήσω αὐτήν


## Notes
This is a "concessive conditional." Because p is factual, most English translations use 'though' or 'even though' rather than 'even if'/


----------------

# Luke 19:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
NASB:
p: (if I have defrauded anyone of anything)
q: (I will give back four times as much)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τινός τι ἐσυκοφάντησα
* _q1_: ἀποδίδωμι τετραπλοῦν


## Notes
From what is known about tax collectors at the time, it is highly likely that Zaccaeus did extort money. He would likely not be in doubt and know for sure as well, so while he presents this as a condtional, he is most likely stating a known fact. Effectively he is saying, "I will pay back four times as much to everyone I have defrauded."


----------------

# Luke 19:31: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (If anyone asks you, 'why are you untying it?')
q: (you shall say this: 'The Lord has need of it.')


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ὑμᾶς ἐρωτᾷ Διὰ τί λύετε
* _q1_: οὕτως ἐρεῖτε ὅτι Ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει


## Notes
Greek: εαν τις 'if anyone'


----------------

# Luke 19:40: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
NASB:
p: (if these become silent)
q: (the stones will cry out)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὗτοι σιωπήσουσιν
* _q1_: οἱ λίθοι κράξουσιν


## Notes
The question of how to read the verbs has a great influence over the interpretation of this conditional. In Greek, both the verb of p and q are future indicative (which is an unusual pairing with εαν). Some English translations interpret this conditional as a counterfactual, referring to the present or pas: the people are not silent, but if they were currently silent, the stones would have/would be crying out. Other English translations (NASB', NIV, NLT) express p as a possible future event: "if they become silent, the stones will cry out."


----------------

# Luke 20:5: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if we say 'from heaven')
q: (he will say 'why did you not believe him')


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν εἴπωμεν Ἐξ οὐρανοῦ
* _q1_: ἐρεῖ Διὰ τί οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ


## Notes
The conditionals in this verse and the next should be understood as a pair; together they give the two possible answers to Jesus' question and the consequences of each.


----------------

# Luke 20:6: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (but if we say 'from man')
q: (all the people will stone us to death)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ εἴπωμεν Ἐξ ἀνθρώπων
* _q1_: ὁ λαὸς ἅπας καταλιθάσει ἡμᾶς


## Notes
See note on v.5.


----------------

# Luke 20:28: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Command


## English
p: (if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children)
q: (the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τινος ἀδελφὸς ἀποθάνῃ ἔχων γυναῖκα καὶ οὗτος ἄτεκνος ᾖ
* _q1_: ἵνα λάβῃ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ ἐξαναστήσῃ σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ


## Notes
This conditional is a sumary of Deutoronomy 25:5-6. The Saducees use this to begin a conversation about the topic of remarriage after a death in order to challenge Jesus.


----------------

# Luke 22:42: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you are willing)
q: (remove this cup from me)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ βούλει
* _q1_: παρένεγκε τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἀπ ἐμοῦ


## Notes
There is a textual variant here that has an infinitive instead of an imperative, which produces, "If you wish to take this cup from me," and elides q.


----------------

# Luke 22:67a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command / Mock


## English
p: (if you are the Christ)
q: (tell us)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: treated as direct question marker ("Tell us, are you the Messiah?")


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ χριστός
* _q1_: εἰπὸν ἡμῖν


## Notes
The Jewish leaders are once again not really interested in genuinely discovering the truth. Nolland views this as another trap in order to have something to accuse Jesus with. In the minds of the speakers, there is very low probability that Jesus is the Christ. However, they want him to state who he is, whether or not he will claim to be Christ. The NLT has a reasonable interpretation, taking this as asking "if/whether."


----------------

# Luke 22:67b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I tell you)
q: (you will not believe)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν ὑμῖν εἴπω
* _q1_: οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε


## Notes
The authorities have already shown in 20:1-8 that their desire is not to discover the truth. They have already made their decision to condemn Jesus and seek only an opportunity for accusation. Jesus' response here and in v.68 shows that he does not intend to answer them, and the "very unlikely" probablity represents Jesus' evaluation.


----------------

# Luke 22:68: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I ask you)
q: (you will not answer)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ ἐρωτήσω
* _q1_: οὐ μὴ ἀποκριθῆτε


## Notes
As in v.67b, the Sanhedrin is not interested in truth, so if Jesus was to ask them a question, they would likely side-step it and refuse to answer, as they did in Luke 20:5-6.


----------------

# Luke 23:31: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if they do these things when the wood is green)
q: (what will happen when it is dry?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν
* _q1_: ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ τί γένηται


## Notes
In this verse, Jesus uses metephorical language to describe what is happening to him (a factual condtion), and asks a rhetorical question (also using the same metaphor) to warn of judgement that will come.


----------------

# Luke 23:35: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Mock


## English
q: (let him save himself)
p: (if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ χριστὸς τοῦ θεοῦ ὁ ἐκλεκτός
* _q1_: σωσάτω ἑαυτόν


## Notes
The challenges in this verse and in v.37 are not genuine, and the the speakers do not believe p is true. They only use p to mock Jesus and scoff at his claims.


----------------

# Luke 23:37: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Mock


## English
p: (if you are the King of the Jews)
q: (save yourself)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων
* _q1_: σῶσον σεαυτόν


## Notes
See note at 23:35.


----------------

# John 1:25: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
q: (then why are you baptizing?)
p: (if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the the Prophet)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Τί οὖν βαπτίζεις
* _p1_: εἰ σὺ οὐκ εἶ ὁ χριστὸς


## Notes
John confirms in the previous verses the truth of p. The question they ask is relevant to John's identity, as his identity would be a signal to them of his authority to baptize.


----------------

# John 3:2: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (no one can do these signs you do)
p: (unless God is with him)


* ESV, NASB: "unless"
NRSV, NLT: untranslated
NIV: "if...not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐδεὶς γὰρ δύναται ταῦτα τὰ σημεῖα ποιεῖν ἃ σὺ ποιεῖς
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ ὁ θεὸς μετ αὐτοῦ


## Notes
This conditional presents Nicodemus's belief in Jesus' miracles being a sign that he is from God. P describes a hypothetical circumstance, even though this conditional as a whole presents a firm belief about miracles in general. While most English translations use "unless" in a similar syntactic form to the Greek, Translator's Notes suggests that it may be better understood by reframing the double negative as a positive (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "for a person can do the signs/miracles that you do only if God is with him." Or "The only way one could...is if God was with him."


----------------

# John 3:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (unless one is born again)
q: (he cannot see the kingdom of God)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "unless"
NRSV: "without"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μή τις γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν
* _q1_: οὐ δύναται ἰδεῖν τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ


## Notes
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "Only if a person is born again can s/he see the Kingdom of God." Or: “The only way for people to enter the Kingdom of God is if they are born again." 
This conditional (and the conditional in 3:5) is used by Jesus to specifically correct misconceptions about how one enters the Kingdom of Heaven (Fong 86).


----------------

# John 3:5: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (unless one is born of water and the Spirit)
q: (he cannot enter the kingdom of God)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "unless"
NRSV, NLT: "without"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μή τις γεννηθῇ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ πνεύματος
* _q1_: οὐ δύναται εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ


## Notes
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "only if a person is born of water and the Spirit can s/he enter into the Kingdom of God." Or: “the only way for people to enter the kingdom of God is if they are born of water and the Spirit."
See note at 3:3.


----------------

# John 3:12a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past / Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if I have told you of earthly things and you do not believe)
q: (how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "if"
NIV: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ τὰ ἐπίγεια εἶπον ὑμῖν
* _q1_: πῶς ἐὰν εἴπω ὑμῖν τὰ ἐπουράνια πιστεύσετε


## Notes
Trail discusses various options for what Jesus is implying by his rhetorical question in q; see note at 3:12b for further discussion regarding the embedded conditional.


----------------

# John 3:12b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
q: (how can you believe?)
p: (if I tell you about heavenly things)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: πῶς … πιστεύσετε
* _p1_: ἐὰν εἴπω ὑμῖν τὰ ἐπουράνια


## Notes
Jesus could be saying that it is useless to teach about heavenly things or that Nicodemus certainly won't believe in heavenly things (these options would make the probability of p unlikely). On the other hand, Jesus could be intending to discuss heavenly things with Nicodemus (which would make the probability of p likely). We are inclined to interpret towards the latter option.


----------------

# John 3:27: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
ESV:
q: (a person cannot receive one thing)
p: (unless it is given to him from heaven)

NRSV:
q: (no one can receive anything)
p: (except what has been given from heaven)


* ESV, NASB, NLT: "unless"
NRSV: "except"
NIV: "only"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Οὐ δύναται ἄνθρωπος λαμβάνειν οὐδὲ ἓν
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ δεδομένον αὐτῷ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ


## Notes
Some scholars believe that John is specifically talking about Jesus because of the disciples' question in v.26. If this is the case, John would be saying that Jesus would not gain followers if God did not give them to him. However, it is also appropriate to interpret this verse as giving a general truth, which applies to Jesus and also to John.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "A person can only recieve something if it is given to him by God." Or: "A person can receive only what is given them from heaven." (NIV)


----------------

# John 4:10: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Rebuke


## English
p: (if you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you "Give me a drink")
q: (you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ᾔδεις τὴν δωρεὰν τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τίς ἐστιν ὁ λέγων σοι
* _q1_: Δός μοι πεῖν σὺ ἂν ᾔτησας αὐτὸν καὶ ἔδωκεν ἄν σοι ὕδωρ ζῶν


## Notes
Jesus uses the conditional to point out what the Samaritan women did not know and the appropriate response to this revelation. Though the woman is surprised Jesus is speaking with her, as Klink points out, "the surprise is greater than [she] can imagine."


----------------

# John 4:48: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (unless you see signs and wonders)
q: (you will not believe)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν μὴ σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἴδητε
* _q1_: οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε


## Notes
The use of plural 'you' pronouns shows that Jesus is addressing the people in general and not just the offical who has requested a miracle from him.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "Only if you(pl) see signs and wonders will you believe."


----------------

# John 5:19: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
NASB:
q: (the Son can do nothing of Himself)
p: (unless it is something he sees the father doing)

NRSV:
q: (the son can do nothing on his own)
p: (but only what he sees the Father doing)


* ESV, NRSV: "but only"
NASB: "unless"
NIV, NLT: separate independent clauses, p has "only"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐ δύναται ὁ υἱὸς ποιεῖν ἀφ ἑαυτοῦ οὐδὲν
* _p1_: ἐὰν μή τι βλέπῃ τὸν πατέρα ποιοῦντα


## Notes
Four of the five sample English translations do not translate this as a conditional, but rather as a conveying a sense of the "only" way p positively takes place (e.g. NIV: "the son can do nothing by himself; he can only do what he sees his Father doing..."). Trail suggests that εαν μη has a meaning of "except" here, but Boyer does not consider this a true "exceptive" use of the condtional as there is no elipsis. Fong claims that this is a conditional and in fact serves as a point of departure for this chunk of discourse (vs.19-30).


----------------

# John 5:31: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I alone bear witness to myself)
q: (my testimony is not true)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν ἐγὼ μαρτυρῶ περὶ ἐμαυτοῦ
* _q1_: ἡ μαρτυρία μου οὐκ ἔστιν ἀληθής


## Notes
Though this is syntactically a class 3 conditional (which usually have neutral probability), Jesus states in the next verse that p is non-factual.


----------------

# John 5:43: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Rebuke


## English
p: (if another comes in his own name)
q: (you will receive him)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἄλλος ἔλθῃ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τῷ ἰδίῳ
* _q1_: ἐκεῖνον λήμψεσθε


## Notes
Klink here notes that Jesus' point here is not to prophesy about another person coming, but rather to talk about in whose authority a person may come. Jesus comes "in my Father's name" (i.e. with God's authority), while others would come simply with their own authority.

* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἐπιστεύετε Μωϋσεῖ
* _q1_: ἐπιστεύετε ἂν ἐμοί


## Notes
Because Jesus has already stated that the audience does not believe him (see v.43) this conditional means that they also do not believe Moses, because Moses wrote about Jesus. Jesus continues this line of thought in v.47.

## Notes
Based on the conclusion in the previous conditional, that belief in Moses equates to belief in Jesus, because Moses wrote about him, Jesus asks a rhetorical question in q. As well as being used to rebuke the audience, Trail notes that this rhetorical question also has a function of expressing sadness (lament).

* _p1_: ἐὰν οὖν θεωρῆτε τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἀναβαίνοντα
* _q1_: ὅπου ἦν τὸ πρότερον


## Notes
Jesus' emphasis here is clearly not on a prediction of what they will or won't see, but on their response if they were to see him ascending to heaven. Some commentators (like Carson) believe Jesus is referring not only to his post-resurrection ascension, but also to the cross.

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ταῦτα ποιεῖς
* _q1_: φανέρωσον σεαυτὸν τῷ κόσμῳ


## Notes
Translator's Notes and Trail both acknowledge that there are two possible readings of this conditional. 1) The brothers could be mocking Jesus; they do not believe that he can do "these things" and are just presenting this as "true for the sake of argument". This reading is supported by v.5, and Klink advocates it. 2) Jesus' brothers were well aware of Jesus' miracles and thus encouraged him to be "public" with his ministry. In this case v.5 would mean that Jesus' brothers did not acknowledge appropriately what his miracles actually meant for them and the world. We have followed the first interpretation and given the illocutionary force as "mock".

## Notes
Translator's Notes mentions that Jesus' statement here applies to anyone but especially to his immediate listeners. Jesus makes a connection between a willingness to do God's will and understanding that Jesus' teaching is truly from God.

* _q1_: ἐμοὶ χολᾶτε ὅτι ὅλον ἄνθρωπον ὑγιῆ ἐποίησα ἐν σαββάτῳ


## Notes
It was true that baby boys were circumcised on the Sabbath if necessary, but Jesus is not referring to a specific occurrence. His point is to show the Pharisees where they are holding a double standard and failing to follow the spirit of the law.

NLT: "before" (no conditional)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Μὴ ὁ νόμος ἡμῶν κρίνει τὸν ἄνθρωπον
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ πρῶτον παρ αὐτοῦ καὶ γνῷ τί ποιεῖ


## Notes
As Klink and Beasley-Murray both note, it was indeed in the Jewish law that judgement should not be passed until someone had spoken for themselves. Nicodemus' view here is more than merely a reminder of legal technicality, but rather a subtle indication that he did not support Jesus' condemnation.
This whole verse is a question that expects the answer "No!" NASB and NRSV do this with a tag question, "does it?" 
Both clauses are negated in Greek (our law does not judge a man if it does not first hear from him...). To avoid multiple negatives, q can be expressed as affirmative (as in the ESV, NRSN, NIV, and NLT). If necessary, the answer to the question can be supplied: "Of course not."
Note also that the Greek literally says that the law judges and hears. If this is unnatural or confusing, here is an alternative: "According to our law, can we judge a man before we have listened to him and learned what he has done? No (we can't)."

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Κἂν ἐγὼ μαρτυρῶ περὶ ἐμαυτοῦ
* _q1_: ἀληθής ἐστιν ἡ μαρτυρία μου


## Notes
Greek: καν; this is a "concessive conditional". It is treated by four of the five English versions as a true conditional including "if".
Though this verse seems to contradict 5:31, Klink explains that "the Son is so dependent on the Father that he is unable to provide a witness for himself; the witness of Jesus must be rooted in the Father (and empowered by the Spirit). But that does not mean that Jesus’s self-witness, when rooted in the Trinitarian identity of God, is not therefore valid and “true.” It is further affirmed in v.18.


----------------

# John 8:16: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present

## English
p: (even if I do judge)
q: (my judgement is true)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "even if"
NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ ἐὰν κρίνω δὲ ἐγώ
* _q1_: ἡ κρίσις ἡ ἐμὴ ἀληθινή ἐστιν


## Notes
Greek: και εαν; this is a "concessive conditional."
Like v.14, this concessive conditional seems to contradict a previous assertion (v.15). Again Klink as well as the Translator's Notes clarify that Jesus does indeed judge, a factual condition. Translator's Notes offer multiple possible interpretations of v.15 which explain how both verses can be simultaneously true.

NLT: "since" + negation


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐμὲ ᾔδειτε
* _q1_: καὶ τὸν πατέρα μου ἂν ᾔδειτε


## Notes
Jesus argues from the fact that the Pharisees do not "know" him, that is, have a relationship with him and know he is God's son (Translator's Notes), they therefore do not know (have a relationship with) the Father.


----------------

# John 8:24: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic

## English
ESV:

q: (you will die in your sins)

NIV: "if...not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γὰρ μὴ πιστεύσητε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι
* _q1_: ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν


## Notes
Klink classifies the Jews' lack of belief as "uncertain, though likely" and notes that it "offers a hint of hope to the Jews." The probability rating "Very Likely" refers to "you do not believe". See NIV: "if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins."

# John 8:31-32: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral

q v.31: (you are truly my disciples)
q v.32: (and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
(NLT inverts)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν ὑμεῖς μείνητε ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῷ ἐμῷ
* _q1_: ἀληθῶς μαθηταί μού ἐστε καὶ γνώσεσθε τὴν ἀλήθειαν καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια ἐλευθερώσει ὑμᾶς


## Notes
Though the verse states that Jesus was speaking to those who believed in him, the passage shows that the faith was not a lasting one. Here Jesus' conditional seems to offer no indication of whether or not he expected the audience to actually "remain" in him. Q seems to contain three clauses, though it is possible to read v. 32 as a separate elaboration of the result of being a disciple (see NIV). If v.32 is included in the q, interestingly, that puts q in v.31 in a different semantic relation than q in v.32. The first is an evidence-inference relationship (abiding in my word shows that you are my disciples), while the second and third clauses in v. 32 would be in a cause-effect relation to p (abiding in my word will cause you to know the truth).

q: (you would be doing the works Abraham did)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ τέκνα τοῦ Ἀβραάμ ἐστε
* _q1_: τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ ἐποιεῖτε


## Notes
It is heavily debated whether this is a factual condition (Jesus is echoing "Abraham is our father") or a non-factual condition (Jesus is expressing his own belief). This is because of a textual variant; the NET translation has the following note: "Although most manuscripts have the imperfect ἦτε (ēte, “you were”) here, making this sentence a proper second class condition, the harder reading, ἐστε (este, “you are”), is found in the better witnesses." English translations that interpret it as factual use the present "If you are..." (NASB, NET); those that interpret it as non-factual use the past subjunctive "if you were" (ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT). Most translations treat q as a statement "you would be doing" (ESV, NRSV, NET) or "you would do" (NIV) but NASB treats q as a command "do the deeds of Abraham." Jesus' point is that though his audience may indeed be Abraham's biological descendents, they were not in fact his spiritual descendents, based on their actions.

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν ἐγὼ δοξάσω ἐμαυτόν
* _q1_: ἡ δόξα μου οὐδέν ἐστιν


## Notes
In v.50 Jesus had said, "I do not seek my own glory," so this conditional represents the presumed belief of the Jews whom Jesus is speaking with; Jesus himself "echoes" this belief in order to refute it.

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: κἂν εἴπω ὅτι οὐκ οἶδα αὐτόν
* _q1_: ἔσομαι ὅμοιος ὑμῖν ψεύστης


## Notes
Greek: καν 'even if'
Jesus continues his arguement and declaration of who he is by asserting his own truthfulness. Here we have a class 3 conditional that is very unlikely. ESV expresses this unlikeliness by using a past subjunctive "iI I were to say...",, NRSV by using "if I would say...", and NIV and NLT by using a simple past "If I said...".

* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἦν οὗτος παρὰ θεοῦ
* _q1_: οὐκ ἠδύνατο ποιεῖν οὐδέν


## Notes
The man continues his arguement by stating what is not true (therefore the opposite must be true), but it was nevertheless the view held by his audience, which he was refuting. 
If possible, the negative conditional should be kept. If an affirmative wording is more natural, it could be expressed using a 'because' clause: "This man was/is able to do this thing only because he is from God."

* _p1_: Εἰ τυφλοὶ ἦτε
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν εἴχετε ἁμαρτίαν


## Notes
Jesus uses figurative language here to rebuke the Pharisees for not believing in him. They are not blind physically, and Jesus, using a non-factual, acknowledges that they are not even totally blind spiritually. They would be less guilty if they were entirely spiritually blind to who Jesus is.

* _p1_: εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ χριστός
* _q1_: εἰπὲ ἡμῖν παρρησίᾳ


## Notes
Beasley-Murray and Trail agree that the intent of the speakers is likely hostile, not a genuine request for information. Therefore, they seem to not be implying a particular probability. They are probably echoining what they have heard people claim about Jesus, or what they assumed Jesus was intending to claim. It is evidently not something that they believe, since they try to stone him (v.31).

* _q1_: ὃν ὁ πατὴρ ἡγίασεν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς τὸν κόσμον ὑμεῖς λέγετε ὅτι Βλασφημεῖς ὅτι εἶπον Υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ εἰμι


## Notes
Jesus has just quoted Psa 82:6 that forms the basis for his claim in the protasis. This verse, along with the next few forms a rebuke from Jesus to the Jewish leaders who have failed as leaders of Israel. Psalm 82 was originally a rebuke of judges of Israel, according to Klink.

NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὐ ποιῶ τὰ ἔργα τοῦ πατρός μου
* _q1_: μὴ πιστεύετέ μοι


## Notes
Jesus presents a conditional that he does not believe to be true, but which he attributes to his hearers. Only in the (false) case where Jesus does not do his Father's work should his audience not believe him. In actual fact, Jesus is doing "good works from the Father' (v.31), but the the Jewish leaders still do not believe him.
The negative conditional should be kept, as the following verse provides the affirmative counterpart of p.

* _p1_: κἂν ἐμοὶ μὴ πιστεύητε
* _q1_: τοῖς ἔργοις πιστεύετε


## Notes
Greek: καν; this is a "concessive conditional".
This conditional should be interpreted as factual (or at least highly likely), as Jesus is aware of his listeners hostility and disbelief which becomes even more evident to readers in the following verse. Because of this, most of the English translations translate as a factual concessive with 'though' rather than 'if'.

# John 11:9: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if anyone walks in the day)
q: (he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV: "those who"
NIV: "anyone who"
NLT: non-conditional statement


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις περιπατῇ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
* _q1_: οὐ προσκόπτει ὅτι τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου τούτου βλέπει


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν τις 'if anyone'
This condtion and the one in v.10 together have a literal meaning and a figurative one. Because it is gnomic (a timeless truth) some English translations have made this non-conditional.


----------------

# John 11:10: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if anyone walks in the night)
q: (he stumbles because the light is not in him)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated/paraphrased as a non-conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δέ τις περιπατῇ ἐν τῇ νυκτί
* _q1_: προσκόπτει ὅτι τὸ φῶς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν τις; see note at v.9.


----------------

# John 11:12: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if he has fallen asleep)
q: (he will recover)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ κεκοίμηται
* _q1_: σωθήσεται


## Notes
The disciples misunderstood Jesus by taking his statement as literally true when he was actually speaking figuratively.


----------------

# John 11:21: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if you had been here)
q: (my brother would not have died)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἦς ὧδε οὐκ
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν ἀπέθανεν ὁ ἀδελφός μου


## Notes
Young says this is a rebuke softened with a conditonal. On the other hand, Beasley-Murray sees this statement as a lament. Trail simply says that this expresses her disapointment and regret that Jesus had not arrived sooner.


----------------

# John 11:25: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (he who believes in me shall live)
p: (even if he dies)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "(even) though"
NASB: "even if"
NLT: "even after"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ κἂν ἀποθάνῃ ζήσεται
* _p1_: κἂν ἀποθάνῃ


## Notes
Greek: κἂν; this is a "concessive conditional". The probability of death does not really seem to be in focus, though logic would say that it is likely (and that Jesus understands it to be).


----------------

# John 11:32: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if you had been here)
q: (my brother would not have died)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἦς ὧδε
* _q1_: οὐκ ἄν μου ἀπέθανεν ὁ ἀδελφός


## Notes
This conditional is identical to that in v.21, however Jesus' reaction to Martha (v.21) and Mary (v.32) is quite different.


----------------

# John 11:40: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Promise


## English
NASB
p: (if you believe)
q: (you will see the glory of God)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν πιστεύσῃς
* _q1_: ὄψῃ τὴν δόξαν τοῦ θεοῦ


## Notes
Trail notes that this verse is a "gentle reprimand" and a "challenge to her faith." Jesus is reporting what he had said earlier (so ESV and NRSV have "if you believed") and does not seem to be stating whether Martha did or not believe.


----------------

# John 11:48: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if we let him go on like this)
q: (everyone will believe in him and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀφῶμεν αὐτὸν οὕτως
* _q1_: πάντες πιστεύσουσιν εἰς αὐτόν καὶ ἐλεύσονται οἱ Ῥωμαῖοι καὶ ἀροῦσιν ἡμῶν καὶ τὸν τόπον καὶ τὸ ἔθνος


## Notes
The Sanhedrin are implying that they should not allow Jesus to continue performing miracles.


----------------

# John 11:57: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if anyone knew where he was)
q: (he should let them know)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV, NIV, NLT: "anyone (who)"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις γνῷ ποῦ ἐστιν
* _q1_: μηνύσῃ ὅπως πιάσωσιν αὐτόν


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν τις 'if anyone'
This is one of the few conditionals in reported speech.


----------------

# John 12:24a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies)
q: (it remains alone)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ὁ κόκκος τοῦ σίτου πεσὼν εἰς τὴν γῆν ἀποθάνῃ
* _q1_: αὐτὸς μόνος μένει


## Notes
In the context of the parable, Jesus is not implying a likelihood or unlikelihood of a seed dying. However, Jesus knew that he (as the one the parable is pointing to figuratively) would in fact die and bring others to life.
The negative conditional shouldbe kept; the following sentence provides the affirmative counterpart of p.


----------------

# John 12:24b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if it dies)
q: (it bears much fruit)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: untranslated/paraphrased as a non-conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ ἀποθάνῃ
* _q1_: πολὺν καρπὸν φέρει


## Notes
See note at v.24a.


----------------

# John 12:26a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if anyone serves me)
q: (he must follow me)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV, NIV: "whoever"
NLT: "anyone who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἐμοί τις διακονῇ
* _q1_: ἐμοὶ ἀκολουθείτω


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν τις 'if anyone'
The first conditional in v.26 expresses a command, and the second conditional expresses the corresponding promise.


----------------

# John 12:26b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if anyone serves me)
q: (the Father will honor him)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone'"
NRSV: "whoever"
NIV: "the one who"
NLT: "anyone who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἐμοὶ διακονῇ
* _q1_: τιμήσει αὐτὸν ὁ πατήρ


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν τις 'if anyone'
See note at v.26a


----------------

# John 12:32: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise / Assert


## English
p: (and I, when I am lifted up from the earth)
q: (will draw all people to myself)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "when"
NASB: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: κἀγὼ ἐὰν ὑψωθῶ ἐκ τῆς γῆς
* _q1_: πάντας ἑλκύσω πρὸς ἐμαυτόν


## Notes
Languages with an "if/when" category could use this here. Trail notes that the meaning of εαν approaches "when/whenever" here and is used to declare "what is expected to occur." Jesus is sure this event will occur, even though it is still in the future; it is his prediction of his death on the cross (Carlton). (See Klink for the alternative view.)


----------------

# John 12:47: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if anyone hears my words and does not keep them)
q: (I do not judge him)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "if anyone"
NRSV: "anyone who"
NLT: untranslated/paraphrased as a non-conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τίς μου ἀκούσῃ τῶν ῥημάτων καὶ μὴ φυλάξῃ
* _q1_: ἐγὼ οὐ κρίνω αὐτόν


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν τις 'if anyone'
Jesus knows that many of those who heard him would not obey him, but the likelihood of this is not in focus.


----------------

# John 13:8: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I do not wash you)
q: (you have no share with me)


* ESV, NASB: "if...not"
NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν μὴ νίψω σε
* _q1_: οὐκ ἔχεις μέρος μετ ἐμοῦ


## Notes
Tthe negative conditional should be kept if possible because Jesus' words "If I do not wash you" echo Peter's words "You will never wash my feet!"


----------------

# John 13:14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if I then, your Lord and Teacher have washed your feet)
q: (you also ought to wash one another's feet)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "now that"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν ἐγὼ ἔνιψα ὑμῶν τοὺς πόδας ὁ κύριος καὶ ὁ διδάσκαλος
* _q1_: καὶ ὑμεῖς ὀφείλετε ἀλλήλων νίπτειν τοὺς πόδας


## Notes
Klink refers to this conditional as an "argument", but according to Young it is primarily an exhortation. We follow Young here.


----------------

# John 13:17a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
p: (if you know these things)
q: (blessed are you if you do them)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: "now that"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ταῦτα οἴδατε
* _q1_: μακάριοί ἐστε ἐὰν ποιῆτε αὐτά


## Notes
Boyer analyzes this conditional as sharing a single apodosis with 17b, however we consider it as containing the 17b conditional embedded within this one. As Boyer himself notes, the first conditional (17a) describes something that is already true (knowing), while the second (17b) is not yet known (doing). While v.17 does pronounce a blessing, it is a condtional blessing. See note at 17b for further discussion.


----------------

# John 13:17b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
q: (blessed are you)
p: (if you do them)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: untranslated/paraphrased as a non-conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: μακάριοί ἐστε
* _p1_: ἐὰν ποιῆτε αὐτά


## Notes
This conditonal is embedded in 17a; see note there. The conditonal here ("if you do them") makes the blessing in 17a conditional on doing as well as on knowing. This is not a factual condition as in v.17a, but Jesus does expect his disciples to follow his example.


----------------

# John 13:32: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if God is glorified in him)
q: (God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὁ θεὸς ἐδοξάσθη ἐν αὐτῷ
* _q1_: καὶ ὁ θεὸς δοξάσει αὐτὸν ἐν αὑτῷ


## Notes
The time reference changes from aorist (past, completed) in p (and preceding context) to future in q. Trail suggests that the use of the aorist indicates that Jesus was so sure of his death and resurrection that he speaks about them as if they were already completed.


----------------

# John 13:35: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
q: (by this all people will know you are my disciples)
p: (if you have love for one another)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: non-conditional staement


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: γνώσονται πάντες ὅτι ἐμοὶ μαθηταί ἐστε
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀγάπην ἔχητε ἐν ἀλλήλοις


## Notes
The "this" (Greek τούτῳ ) in q refers forward to the whole of p. This may be unnatural in some languages, and it may be better to put p before q. NLT does this, and also removes the conditional: "Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.”


----------------

# John 14:2: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past / Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
ESV:
p: (If it were not so)
q: (would I have told you that I go and prepare a place for you?)

NASB:
p: (if it were not so)
q: (I would have told you) for/because I go to prepare a place for you


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if...not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή
* _q1_: εἶπον ἂν ὑμῖν ὅτι πορεύομαι ἑτοιμάσαι τόπον ὑμῖν


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή with an elided (understood) verb is often translated simply as "if not" or "otherwise". This phrase presents the alternative to "In my Father's house are many rooms" in the previous clause. The effect of this conditional is to assure the disciples that Jesus will, indeed, "prepare a place" for them. 
The majority of translations (ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT) treat q as a rhetorical question referring to indirect speech; others (NASB, NET) have only "I would have told you" in q, and treat "I go to prepare a place for you" as a separate statement.


----------------

# John 14:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if I go and prepare a place for you)
q: (I will come again and take you to myself, that where I am you may be also)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν πορευθῶ καὶ ἑτοιμάσω τόπον ὑμῖν
* _q1_: πάλιν ἔρχομαι καὶ παραλήμψομαι ὑμᾶς πρὸς ἐμαυτόν


## Notes
Although the Greek has a class 3 conditional, this is clearly factual; the force of this conditional sentence is a promise rather than an argument.


----------------

# John 14:7: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual / Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Future / Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Rebuke


## English
Our own translation:
p: (if you have known me)
q: (you know my Father also)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐγνώκειτέ με
* _q1_: καὶ τὸν πατέρα μου


## Notes
We have chosen to analyze this as a factual conditional, based on the UBS Greek text with a class 1 conditional. Some manuscripts have a pluperfect verb in both p and q (and an αν in q), which is evidently the interpreatation most of the English translations take. However, the UBS Greek has a perfect verb in p and a future verb in q (with the variants listed in the footnotes); the interpretation in the NIV is based on this. The alternative class 2 interpreation seems to imply that the disciples haven't really known Jesus, but now do. There is merit in both interpretations, and Jesus' point either way is that he and the Father are one; knowledge of him is the same thing as knowledge of the Father, so the disciples do indeed know the Father.


----------------

# John 14:11: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command / Exhort


## English
NET:
p: (if you do not believe me)
q: (believe because of the miraculous deeds themselves)


* ESV: "or else"
NASB: "otherwise"
NRSV: "but if...not"
NIV, NLT: "or at least"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή
* _q1_: διὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτὰ πιστεύετε


## Notes
εἰ δὲ μή with an elided (understood) verb "if not" or "otherwise".


----------------

# John 14:14: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if you ask me anything in my name)
q: (I will do it)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: implied conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τι αἰτήσητέ με ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου
* _q1_: ἐγὼ ποιήσω


## Notes
This conditional is used to restate and reinforce the promise made in v.13, hence NLT: "Yes, ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it!"


----------------

# John 14:15: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you love me)
q: (you will keep my commandments)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν ἀγαπᾶτέ με
* _q1_: τὰς ἐντολὰς τὰς ἐμὰς τηρήσετε


## Notes
The 'you' here is plural.


----------------

# John 14:23: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if anyone loves me)
q: (he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV: "those who"
NIV: "anyone who"
NLT: "all who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐάν τις ἀγαπᾷ με
* _q1_: τὸν λόγον μου τηρήσει καὶ ὁ πατήρ μου ἀγαπήσει αὐτόν καὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐλευσόμεθα καὶ μονὴν παρ αὐτῷ ποιησόμεθα


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν τις 'if anyone'
In v.15 Jesus was addressing his disciples, but here he is talking about "the world" (v.22).


----------------

# John 14:28: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if you loved me)
q: (you would have rejoiced [that] I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἠγαπᾶτέ με
* _q1_: ἐχάρητε ἄν ὅτι πορεύομαι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα ὅτι ὁ πατὴρ μείζων μού ἐστιν


## Notes
Jesus indicates here that the disciples ought to view his departure positively (Klink). Trail notes that due to this being a contrary-to-fact condition, Jesus shows that "their love is not genuine love." However, Boyer reads the durative imperfect verbal aspect in the verse as indicating Jesus was referring to the instance of time when he had told them, "I am going away, but I will come back again to you." The disciples did not have genuine love at that time, but this does not mean they never exhibited genuine love. Jesus' ulitmate purpose in telling them this is so that they can indeed have true love and rejoice at his ascension.


----------------

# John 15:4a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself)
p: (unless it abides in the vine)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "unless"
NIV: non-conditional statement
NLT: "if it is severed..." (antonymical verb)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καθὼς τὸ κλῆμα οὐ δύναται καρπὸν φέρειν ἀφ ἑαυτοῦ
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ μένῃ ἐν τῇ ἀμπέλῳ


## Notes
15:4a and b are one sentence, used together to argue the necessity that the disciples "remain" in Christ: v.4a describes the relation between a vine and its fruit, and v.4b applies this to Jesus and his disciples.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless'): "A branch can only bear fruit if it remains in the vine. In the same way, you can only bear fruit if you remain in me." (Translators should also consider the words to use for 'branch' and 'vine', and whether "remain in me" is a metaphor that communicates clearly and naturally.)
NLT uses an affirmative conditional with a verb that means the opposite of 'remain': "a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed [cut off] from the vine."
Digo translation: "Hold tightly* to me, and I will hold tightly to you. For a branch cannot bear fruit alone, until it holds tightly to the vine itself. So it is with you also, you cannot bear fruits until you hold tightly to me." (* 'Hold tightly' is a translation of "gbwirana", the reciprocal form of the verb 'hold'; it can also mean 'be attached to'.)


----------------

# John 15:4b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic

## English
q: (neither can you)
p: (unless you abide in me)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὕτως οὐδὲ ὑμεῖς
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἐν ἐμοὶ μένητε


## Notes
See note at 15:4a. (See note at 15:6 for discussion of the implied conditional in 15:5.)


----------------

# John 15:6: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if anyone does not abide in me)
q: (he is thrown away like a branch and withers)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone does not"
NIV: "if you do not"
NRSV: "whoever does not"
NLT: "anyone who does not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μή τις μένῃ ἐν ἐμοί
* _q1_: ἐβλήθη ἔξω ὡς τὸ κλῆμα καὶ ἐξηράνθη


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μή τις 'unless someone'
This verse provides the negative counterpart to v.5, which in Greek is "the one remaining in me and I in him, this one bears much fruit." This is an implied conditional. Because Jesus is addressing his disciples directly, NIV has expressed v.5 as a conditional with "you": “If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit." NIV continues to use "you" in v.6 "If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers..."


----------------

# John 15:7a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if you abide in me and my words abide in you)
q: (ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μείνητε ἐν ἐμοὶ καὶ τὰ ῥήματά μου ἐν ὑμῖν μείνῃ
* _q1_: ὃ ἐὰν θέλητε αἰτήσασθε καὶ γενήσεται ὑμῖν


## Notes
Jesus repeats the promise given in 14:14 in q (so q has an implied condition); p presents an additional condition.


----------------

# John 15:10: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if you keep my commandments)
q: (you will abide in my love)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν τὰς ἐντολάς μου τηρήσητε
* _q1_: μενεῖτε ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ μου


## Notes
Klink notes that "obedience springs from love and is the response to love, not the reverse." He emphasizes that in the context of the passage, it is clear that it is humans who respond to God, not God responding to the actions of humans. This makes Jesus' statment less of a promise (as it may sound) and more of an assertion that the disciples' obedience is an indicator of their love for God.


----------------

# John 15:14: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (you are my friends)
p: (if you do what I command you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ὑμεῖς φίλοι μού ἐστε
* _p1_: ἐὰν ποιῆτε ἃ ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι ὑμῖν


## Notes
In light of the following vereses where Jesus elaborates on calling his disciples friends, it becomes clear that as in v.10, this condition does not indicate temporal order (as if the disciples only become Jesus' friends after they show obedience). Rather, Jesus is saying that their obedience is proof that they are truly his friends.

* _q1_: γινώσκετε ὅτι ἐμὲ πρῶτον ὑμῶν μεμίσηκεν


## Notes
In 15:19b, Jesus states, "I chose you out of the world, so the world hates you." From this, it is clear that p expreses a fact rather than just a possibility.

# John 15:19a: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if you were of the world)
q: (the world would love you as its own)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου ἦτε
* _q1_: ὁ κόσμος ἂν τὸ ἴδιον ἐφίλει


## Notes
Jesus uses a non-factual condtional to express the negative counterpart of v.19b.


----------------

# John 15:20b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past / Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if they persecuted me)
q: (they will also persecute you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐμὲ ἐδίωξαν
* _q1_: καὶ ὑμᾶς διώξουσιν


## Notes
In Jhn 15:18-19, Jesus has warned his disciples that the world will hate them, just as the world has hated him. He uses a conditional in v.20b to emphasize that the way others have treated him (which is known) indicates the way that others will treat the disciples (which the disciples have not yet experienced).


----------------

# John 15:20c: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual / Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past / Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if they kept my word) q: (they will also keep yours)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ τὸν λόγον μου ἐτήρησαν
* _q1_: καὶ τὸν ὑμέτερον τηρήσουσιν


## Notes
One interpretation of this conditional is that it refers to a different group of people than in v.20b (or to a sub-group of people within the general group referred to as “the world”). Carson (1991) explains: ‘If they persecuted me (and many of them did), they will persecute you also; if they obeyed my teaching (and some of them did), they will obey yours also.’ If this interpretation is followed, one possible way to translate v.20b-c is: "Those who persecuted me will also persecute you(pl), and/but those who kept my word will also keep yours(pl)."
An alternative interpretation, noted by Carson (1991) and Beasley-Murray (1999), treats the conditional in v.20c as non-factual and therefore complementary to rather than in contrast with v.20b. This interpretation accords with the overall theme of Jhn 15:18-25, which is that the people of the world hate Jesus and will therefore also hate the disciples, and is followed in the NLT: "Since they persecuted me, naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would listen to you."


----------------

# John 15:22: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I had not come and spoken to them)
q: (they would not have been guilty of sin)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἦλθον καὶ ἐλάλησα αὐτοῖς
* _q1_: ἁμαρτίαν οὐκ εἴχοσαν


## Notes
Both p and q are negative; Jesus is in effect saying "Because I came and spoke to them, they are guilty of sin."


----------------

# John 15:24: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I had not done among them the works that no one else did)
q: (they would not be guilty of sin)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ τὰ ἔργα μὴ ἐποίησα ἐν αὐτοῖς ἃ οὐδεὶς ἄλλος ἐποίησεν
* _q1_: ἁμαρτίαν οὐκ εἴχοσαν


## Notes
Both p and q are negative; Jesus is in effect saying "Because I did among them the works (miracles) that no one else did, they are guilty of sin."


----------------

# John 16:7a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if I do not go away)
q: (the Helper will not come to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "if"
NIV: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γὰρ μὴ ἀπέλθω
* _q1_: ὁ παράκλητος οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς


## Notes
There are two conditional constructions in this verse: a negative one, and then an affirmative counterpart. Because of this, the first conditional should be kept as negative if possible. If it is not possible, it can be made affirmative and the second conditional abbreviated: "only if I go away will the Helper (Advocate) come to you; yes, I will send him to you."
Although Jesus presents two alternative scenarios (the first of which he knows is false and the second he knows is true), they have the same form in Greek, and are presented as hypothetical alternatives.


----------------

# John 16:7b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if I go)
q: (I will send him to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ πορευθῶ
* _q1_: πέμψω αὐτὸν πρὸς ὑμᾶς


## Notes
See note at 16:7a.


----------------

# John 18:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if you seek me)
q: (let these men go)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν ἐμὲ ζητεῖτε
* _q1_: ἄφετε τούτους ὑπάγειν


## Notes
It has been established in the context that they are indeed seeking Jesus; the condtional here does not express doubt. See NLT: "since I am the one you want, let these others go."


----------------

# John 18:23a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if what I said is wrong)
q: (bear witness about the wrong)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ κακῶς ἐλάλησα
* _q1_: μαρτύρησον περὶ τοῦ κακοῦ


## Notes
Jesus is not admitting that he said something wrong; he is expressing what the Temple guard believed.


----------------

# John 18:23b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if what I said is right)
q: (why do you strike me?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ καλῶς
* _q1_: τί με δέρεις


## Notes
Jesus knows tnat what he said was right, but this is presented as an alternative to 18:23a.


----------------

# John 18:30: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if this man were not a criminal)
q: (we would not have handed him over to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
(NLT inverts p and q)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ μὴ ἦν οὗτος κακὸν ποιῶν
* _q1_: οὐκ ἄν σοι παρεδώκαμεν αὐτόν


## Notes
It is important to note that this conditional is non-factual in the opinion of the speakers, though historically it is true that Jesus was not a criminal. (ESV has the verbal "doing evil" rather than the nominal "a criminal".)
Both p and q are negative; if it is difficult to keep two negatives in your translation, this can be expressed as "We have handed him over to you because he is a criminal." It should be clear that the Jewish leaders are not giving a direct answer to Pilate's question in v.29.


----------------

# John 18:36: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if my kingdom were of this world)
q: (my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου ἦν ἡ βασιλεία ἡ ἐμή
* _q1_: οἱ ὑπηρέται οἱ ἐμοὶ ἠγωνίζοντο ἄν ἵνα μὴ παραδοθῶ τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις


## Notes
Jesus has just stated, "My kingdom is not of this world," so NIV and NLT reduce p to "If it were".


----------------

# John 19:11: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (you would have no authority over me at all)
p: (unless it had been given you from above)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "unless"
NIV: "if...not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Οὐκ εἶχες ἐξουσίαν κατ ἐμοῦ οὐδεμίαν
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἦν δεδομένον σοι ἄνωθεν


## Notes
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "You only have authority over me because* it has been given to you from above."
*Jesus is responding to Pilate's question in v.10 "Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?" It is a fact that Pilate has authority over Jesus, and for this reason it may be better to use "because" rather than a conditional.


----------------

# John 19:12: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if you release this man)
q: (you are not Caesar's friend)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν τοῦτον ἀπολύσῃς
* _q1_: οὐκ εἶ φίλος τοῦ Καίσαρος


----------------

# John 20:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you have carried him away)
q: (tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ σὺ ἐβάστασας αὐτόν
* _q1_: εἰπέ μοι ποῦ ἔθηκας αὐτόν κἀγὼ αὐτὸν ἀρῶ


----------------

# John 20:23a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (If you forgive the sins of any)
q: (they are forgiven them)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLY: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἄν τινων ἀφῆτε τὰς ἁμαρτίας
* _q1_: ἀφέωνται αὐτοῖς


## Notes
There are two conditional sentences here, presenting alternative scenarios. The form of the conditional is unusual; ἄν τινων is a construction meaing 'if someone' or 'whoever'.


----------------

# John 20:23b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if you withold forgiveness from any) q: (it is withheld)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLY: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἄν τινων κρατῆτε
* _q1_: κεκράτηνται


## Notes
There are two conditional sentences here, presenting alternative scenarios. The form of the conditional is unusual; ἄν τινων is a construction meaing 'if someone' or 'whoever'.


----------------

# John 20:25: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side)
q: (I will never believe)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"
(NLT inverted)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν μὴ ἴδω ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ τὸν τύπον τῶν ἥλων καὶ βάλω τὸν δάκτυλόν μου εἰς τὸν τύπον τῶν ἥλων καὶ βάλω μου τὴν χεῖρα εἰς τὴν πλευρὰν αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: οὐ μὴ πιστεύσω


## Notes
Very Likely is the probability of the negative condition; Thomas expected that it was " Very Likely" he would not see the nail marks or place his hand in Jesus' side.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless'): “Only if I see in his hands the wound of the nails, and put my finger into the wound of the nails, and put my hand into his side, will I believe.” Or: "I will believe only if I see in his hands the wound of the nails, and put my finger into the wound of the nails, and put my hand into his side."


----------------

# John 21:22: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if it is my will that he remain until I come)
q: (what is that to you?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν αὐτὸν θέλω μένειν ἕως ἔρχομαι
* _q1_: τί πρὸς σέ


## Notes
Jesus is not intending to imply any likelihood in this conditonal, which is made clear by John's explanation in v.23.


----------------

# John 21:23: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if it is my will that he remain until I come)
q: (what is that to you?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν αὐτὸν θέλω μένειν ἕως ἔρχομαι
* _q1_: τί πρὸς σέ


## Notes
Identical to v.22.


----------------

# John 21:25: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
NASB
p: (if they were written in detail)
q: (I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that would be written)


* ESV: "were [they] to be written"
NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἅτινα ἐὰν γράφηται καθ ἕν
* _q1_: οὐδ αὐτὸν οἶμαι τὸν κόσμον χωρήσειν τὰ γραφόμενα βιβλία


## Notes
It is clear from the conclusion drawn in q that John does not expect this conditional could possibly be fullfilled. His point is to emphasize how many great things Jesus did.


----------------

# Acts 4:9-10: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed)
q: (let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth... this man is standing before you well.)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: untranslated/paraphrased as a non-conditional in the form of a direct question marker


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἡμεῖς σήμερον ἀνακρινόμεθα ἐπὶ εὐεργεσίᾳ ἀνθρώπου ἀσθενοῦς
* _q1_: γνωστὸν ἔστω πᾶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραὴλ ὅτι ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ Ναζωραίου ὃν ὑμεῖς ἐσταυρώσατε ὃν ὁ θεὸς ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν ἐν τούτῳ οὗτος παρέστηκεν ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ὑγιής


## Notes
This is an example of a speech act conditional; q is true regardless of whether p is true - p simply states why it is relevant to know q. The NLT uses a rhetorical question to accomplish the same function.


----------------

# Acts 4:19: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God)
q: (you must judge)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whether"
NIV, NLT: translated as a direct question


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δίκαιόν ἐστιν ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν ἀκούειν μᾶλλον ἢ τοῦ θεοῦ
* _q1_: κρίνατε


## Notes
When there is a choice within p, English often expresses this using 'whether' rather than 'if'.


----------------

# Acts 5:38b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if this plan or this undertaking is of man)
q: (it will fail)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ᾖ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων ἡ βουλὴ αὕτη ἢ τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο
* _q1_: καταλυθήσεται


## Notes
Gamaliel uses the conditionals in v.38b and v.39a to present the two possible situations: either the apostles are acting on their own authority, or they are acting with God's authority. These possible situations have two corresponding outcomes: either their activities will come to nothing, or they will succeed, and the Sanhedrin will not be able to stop them.


----------------

# Acts 5:39a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (but if it is of God)
q: (you will not be able to overthrow them)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἐκ θεοῦ ἐστιν
* _q1_: οὐ δυνήσεσθε καταλῦσαι αὐτούς


## Notes
See note at v38. Even though this conditional is class 1 (which typically expresses factual conditions) this seems to be simply presenting the alternative to teh conditional in v.38b.


----------------

# Acts 8:31: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
q: (how can I [understand what I am reading])
p: (unless someone guides me)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Πῶς γὰρ ἂν δυναίμην
* _p1_: ἐὰν μή τις ὁδηγήσει με


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν μή...αν + a verb in the optative
Elliot suggests that the optative could be used to "expres a request in deferential style," which fits this context well.  
Translation considerations:
If q remains as a question, p should remain as a negative conditional: "How can I (understand) if someone does not guide/teach me?" Or: "How can I (understand) unless someone guides/teaches me?" Or: "How can I understand if no one guides/teaches me?"
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless':
1) express p as a statement: "There is no one to guide/teach me, so how can I understand?" or "How can I understand without someone to teach me?"
2) express q as a statement: "I can only understand if someone guides/me (but there is no one)."
3) express p and q as statements: "There is no one to guide/teach me, so I can not understand." or "I can not understand because there is no one to guide/teach me."


----------------

# Acts 9:2: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women)
q: (he might bring them bound to Jerusalem)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: untranslated/paraphrased as a non-conditional in the form of indirect speech


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὅπως ἐάν τινας εὕρῃ τῆς ὁδοῦ ὄντας ἄνδρας τε καὶ γυναῖκας
* _q1_: δεδεμένους ἀγάγῃ εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ


## Notes
The conditinoal occurs in indirect speech. If this is not natural or clear, it could be rephrased without a conditional as the NLT does.


----------------

# Acts 11:17: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if God then gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ)
q: (who was I that I could stand in God's way?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὖν τὴν ἴσην δωρεὰν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ θεὸς ὡς καὶ ἡμῖν πιστεύσασιν ἐπὶ τὸν κύριον Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν
* _q1_: ἐγὼ τίς ἤμην δυνατὸς κωλῦσαι τὸν θεόν


----------------

# Acts 13:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you have any word of encouragement for the people)
q: (say it)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἐν ὑμῖν λόγος παρακλήσεως πρὸς τὸν λαόν
* _q1_: λέγετε


## Notes
This conditional is a polite invitation to Paul and his companions to speak. If conditionals are not used in this way in your language, use an appropriate form for a polite invitation or request.


----------------

# Acts 13:41: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe)
p: (even if one tells it to you)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "even if"
NASB: "though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ὃ οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἐκδιηγῆται ὑμῖν


## Notes
This is a "concessive conditional," occuring in a quotation of Old Testament prophecy. The concessive tone does not necessarily imply that p is unlikely. In fact, in the OT quotation, p was real as the re told about this "work" in the following verses.


----------------

# Acts 15:1: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses)
q: (you cannot be saved)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν μὴ περιτμηθῆτε τῷ ἔθει τῷ Μωϋσέως
* _q1_: οὐ δύνασθε σωθῆναι


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν μή 'unless'
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless'): "You can be saved only if you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses."
(This conditional is factual because the speakers thought that p was true, even though Paul and Barnabas disagreed.)


----------------

# Acts 16:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (if you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord)
q: (come to my house and stay)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ κεκρίκατέ με πιστὴν τῷ κυρίῳ εἶναι
* _q1_: εἰσελθόντες εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου μένετε


## Notes
Lydia is not doubting whether she is a true believer; rather, she is using a conditional to express a polite invitation (as in 13:15).


----------------

# Acts 18:14: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if this were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime)
q: (I would have reason to accept your complaint)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ μὲν ἦν ἀδίκημά τι ἢ ῥᾳδιούργημα πονηρόν
* _q1_: κατὰ λόγον ἂν ἀνεσχόμην ὑμῶν


## Notes
This verse and the next (v.15) form a pair in which the speaker compares two situations, one false and the other true.


----------------

# Acts 18:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (since it is a matter of questions and words and names and your own law)
q: (see to it yourselves)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "since"
NASB: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ζητήματά ἐστιν περὶ λόγου καὶ ὀνομάτων καὶ νόμου τοῦ καθ ὑμᾶς
* _q1_: ὄψεσθε αὐτοί


## Notes
See note at v.14.


----------------

# Acts 19:38: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone)
q: (the courts are open and there are proconsuls)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὲν οὖν Δημήτριος καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ τεχνῖται ἔχουσιν πρός τινα λόγον
* _q1_: ἀγοραῖοι ἄγονται καὶ ἀνθύπατοί εἰσιν


## Notes
This is a speech act conditional; q is true regardless of whether p is true - p states why it is relevant to know q.


----------------

# Acts 19:39: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (but if you seek anything further)
q: (it shall be settled in a regular assembly)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τι περαιτέρω ἐπιζητεῖτε
* _q1_: ἐν τῇ ἐννόμῳ ἐκκλησίᾳ ἐπιλυθήσεται


## Notes
Although the form of this conditional is the same as in v.38, it does not seem to be factual.


----------------

# Acts 22:25: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Question


## English
Greek:
p: (if a man [is] a Roman citizen and uncondemned)
q: (Ιs it lawful for you to flog [him]?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: translated as a relative clause "who is..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἄνθρωπον Ῥωμαῖον καὶ ἀκατάκριτον
* _q1_: ἔξεστιν ὑμῖν μαστίζειν


## Notes
Although none of the English translations listed translate this as a conditional, it has the form of a conditional in Greek and can be understood as having a conditional meaning. Paul knows that it is not legal for the centurion to whip a Roman citizen who has not been found guilty of a crime, so this is a rhetorical question.

# Acts 23:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (what if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?)
q: missing


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "what if"
NASB: "suppose"
NLT: "perhaps"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ πνεῦμα ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ ἢ ἄγγελος


## Notes
Boyer and Elliot consider this a true condition with an elipsed q. They do not comment on what the q would be. We think that if stated, it would likely be an assertion that Paul would be innocent under the condtion of p.


----------------

# Acts 24:19: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
NRSV:
q: (they ought to be here before you to make accusation)
p: (if they have anything against me)


* ESV: "should they have" (conditional sense)
NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τινὲς δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀσίας Ἰουδαῖοι οὓς ἔδει ἐπὶ σοῦ παρεῖναι καὶ κατηγορεῖν
* _p1_: εἴ τι ἔχοιεν πρὸς ἐμέ


----------------

# Acts 25:5: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if there is anything wrong about the man)
q: (let them bring charges against him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τί ἐστιν ἐν τῷ ἀνδρὶ ἄτοπον
* _q1_: κατηγορείτωσαν αὐτοῦ


## Notes
Although this is a class 1 conditional, which are often factual, there is evidence that Festus believes that Paul has done anything wrong.


----------------

# Acts 25:11a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die)
q: (I do not seek to escape death)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὲν οὖν ἀδικῶ καὶ ἄξιον θανάτου πέπραχά τι
* _q1_: οὐ παραιτοῦμαι τὸ ἀποθανεῖν


## Notes
Paul uses two conditionals in 11a and 11b to show the powo possible situations (he is either guilty or not guilty) and the consequences of these situations (either he should die or he should be released).


----------------

# Acts 25:11b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (but if there is nothing to their charges against me)
q: (no one can give me up to them)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ οὐδέν ἐστιν ὧν οὗτοι κατηγοροῦσίν μου
* _q1_: οὐδείς με δύναται αὐτοῖς χαρίσασθαι


## Notes
See note at v.11a.


----------------

# Acts 26:5: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
NLT:
p: (if they would admit it)
q: (they know that I have been a member of the Pharisees, the strictest sect of our religion)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν θέλωσι μαρτυρεῖν ὅτι κατὰ τὴν ἀκριβεστάτην αἵρεσιν τῆς ἡμετέρας θρησκείας ἔζησα Φαρισαῖος
* _q1_: προγινώσκοντές με ἄνωθεν


## Notes
Q is true regardless of p. If this is not clear using a conditional construction in your language, it can be rephrased as a statement: "They know that I have been a member of the Pharisees, the strictest sect of our religion, but they are not willing to admit it."


----------------

# Acts 26:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
NASB: 
q: (why is it considered incredible among you)
p: (if God does raise the dead?)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "that"
NASB: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τί ἄπιστον κρίνεται παρ ὑμῖν
* _p1_: εἰ ὁ θεὸς νεκροὺς ἐγείρει


## Notes
Many English translations do not treat this as a conditional, but instead translate ει 'if' as a complementizer 'that'. Hoowever, it can also be interpreted as introducing a factual condition: "if God raises the dead (which he does), why should any of you think that this is unbeleivable?"


----------------

# Acts 26:32: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (this man might have been set free)
p: (if he had not appealed to Caesar)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Ἀπολελύσθαι ἐδύνατο ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἐπεκέκλητο Καίσαρα


----------------

# Acts 27:31: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Warn


## English
p: (unless these men stay in the ship = if these men do not stay in the ship)
q: (you cannot be saved)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν μὴ οὗτοι μείνωσιν ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ
* _q1_: ὑμεῖς σωθῆναι οὐ δύνασθε


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν μή 'unless'
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "Only if these men remain in the ship can you be saved." Or: "You can be saved only if these men remain in the ship."


----------------

# Rom 2:17-21: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are intructed from the law; and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of truth)
q: (you then who teach others, do not teach yourself)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δὲ σὺ Ἰουδαῖος ἐπονομάζῃ καὶ ἐπαναπαύῃ νόμῳ καὶ καυχᾶσαι ἐν θεῷ καὶ γινώσκεις τὸ θέλημα καὶ δοκιμάζεις τὰ διαφέροντα κατηχούμενος ἐκ τοῦ νόμου πέποιθάς τε σεαυτὸν ὁδηγὸν εἶναι τυφλῶν φῶς τῶν ἐν σκότει παιδευτὴν ἀφρόνων διδάσκαλον νηπίων ἔχοντα τὴν μόρφωσιν τῆς γνώσεως καὶ τῆς ἀληθείας ἐν τῷ νόμῳ
* _q1_: ὁ οὖν διδάσκων ἕτερον σεαυτὸν οὐ διδάσκεις


## Notes
Paul lists the priviledges of being a Jew and then admonishes them for the way they act (Kruse). Essentially, Paul is saying, "if you know so much, why do you act in this way?"
In the greek ει is only used once at the beginning, in most English translations "if" is used more than once (e.g. ESV and NRSV in vs.17 & 19, NIV four times in vs.17-19) so the reader knows that the conditional is continuing. NLT makes vs.17-20 statements and uses "if" in the first rhetorical question in v.21.
Since p is vs.17-20, q could be considered to encompass all four rhetorical questions in the rest of vs.21 and 22.


----------------

# Rom 2:25a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (For circumcision indeed is of value)
p: (if you obey the law)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "only if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἐὰν νόμον πράσσῃς
* _p1_: Περιτομὴ μὲν γὰρ ὠφελεῖ


## Notes
Circumcision was a sign that set the Jews apart from the other nations, but Paul says that it is only important if it is accompanied by obedience to the Jewish law. Paul is presenting obeying the law as possible, even though it is clear from the context that no one was completely obedient to the law.


----------------

# Rom 2:25b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (but if you break the law)
q: (your circumcision becomes uncircumcision)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ παραβάτης νόμου ᾖς
* _q1_: ἡ περιτομή σου ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν


## Notes
Paul is presenting breaking the law as hypothetical, even though it is clear from the context that everyone will break the law at some point


----------------

# Rom 2:26: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (so, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law)
q: (will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὖν ἡ ἀκροβυστία τὰ δικαιώματα τοῦ νόμου φυλάσσῃ
* _q1_: οὐχ ἡ ἀκροβυστία αὐτοῦ εἰς περιτομὴν λογισθήσεται


## Notes
A rhetorical question intended to be answered positively (which Paul does in verses 27-29).


----------------

# Rom 3:3: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past / Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
What then?
p: (If some did not believe,)
q: (their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it?) (NASB)


* NASB: "if"
ESV, NRSV, NIV: "what if"
NLT: "just because"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἠπίστησάν τινες
* _q1_: μὴ ἡ ἀπιστία αὐτῶν τὴν πίστιν τοῦ θεοῦ καταργήσει


## Notes
P expresses something that is known to be true (some did not believe), and q is a rhetorical question that expects a negative answer.
The ESV, NRSV and NIV express this as two rhetorical questions:
p: (what if some were unfaithful?)
q: (does their faithfulness nullify the faithfulness of God?)


----------------

# Rom 3:5: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (but if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God,)
q: (what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: not translated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἡ ἀδικία ἡμῶν θεοῦ δικαιοσύνην συνίστησιν
* _q1_: τί ἐροῦμεν μὴ ἄδικος ὁ θεὸς ὁ ἐπιφέρων τὴν ὀργήν


## Notes
In 3:5 and 3:7 Paul is presenting the kind of argument that his opponents might use (NLT "some might say"), namely that if our sins demonstrate God's righteousness, we do not deserve to be punished for our sin. As in 3:3, q is a rhetorical question that expects a negative answer.


----------------

# Rom 3:7: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory)
q: (why am I still being condemned as a sinner?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT : "some might say"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἡ ἀλήθεια τοῦ θεοῦ ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ ψεύσματι ἐπερίσσευσεν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: τί ἔτι κἀγὼ ὡς ἁμαρτωλὸς κρίνομαι


## Notes
Paul is presenting the kind of argument that his opponents might use, and some translations make this explicit, e.g. NIV, NLT: "Someone might argue..."
Q expects an answer, "There is no reason why I should be condemned as a sinner."


----------------

# Rom 3:29-30: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: ([He is God] of the Gentiles also)
p: (since God is one)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "since"
NLT: not translated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: εἴπερ εἷς ὁ θεός
* _p1_: ναὶ καὶ ἐθνῶν


## Notes
Greek: εἴπερ 'since'
Because God created the whole of humankind the Jews cannot claim God for themselves alone (even though they hold special importance as Paul points out throughout the letter).


----------------

# Rom 4:2: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if Abraham was justified by works)
q: (he has something to boast about)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ Ἀβραὰμ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη
* _q1_: ἔχει καύχημα


## Notes
Paul explains that this conditional is non-factual at the end of v3 "Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness" It was not Abraham's works which saved him or brought him righteousness, but his faith. The NIV makes this clear by adding "in fact" after "if".


----------------

# Rom 4:14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs)
q: (faith is null and the promise is void)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ οἱ ἐκ νόμου κληρονόμοι
* _q1_: κεκένωται ἡ πίστις καὶ κατήργηται ἡ ἐπαγγελία


## Notes
In v.13 Paul stated, the promise to Abraham ... that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law..." From this, it is clear that p is non-factual, and so q is false: faith is not null, and the promise is not void.


----------------

# Rom 5:10: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son)
q: (much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἐχθροὶ ὄντες κατηλλάγημεν τῷ θεῷ διὰ τοῦ θανάτου τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: πολλῷ μᾶλλον καταλλαγέντες σωθησόμεθα ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτοῦ


## Notes
Paul uses several of these "how much more" statements (5:10, 15, 17, 11:12, 24) to try to explain how amazing God's grace is. Instead of q being dependant on p (as is usually the case in conditional sentences), p and q are compared: we were reconciled by Christ's death; we will certainly be saved by his life.


----------------

# Rom 5:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (for if many died through one man's trespass)
q: (much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: q is introduced by "but"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ τῷ τοῦ ἑνὸς παραπτώματι οἱ πολλοὶ ἀπέθανον
* _q1_: πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἡ χάρις τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ ἡ δωρεὰ ἐν χάριτι τῇ τοῦ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ εἰς τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐπερίσσευσεν


## Notes
See 5:10


----------------

# Rom 5:17: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (for if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man)
q: (how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: q is introduced by "but"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ τῷ τοῦ ἑνὸς παραπτώματι ὁ θάνατος ἐβασίλευσεν διὰ τοῦ ἑνός
* _q1_: πολλῷ μᾶλλον οἱ τὴν περισσείαν τῆς χάριτος καὶ τῆς δωρεᾶς τῆς δικαιοσύνης λαμβάνοντες ἐν ζωῇ βασιλεύσουσιν διὰ τοῦ ἑνὸς Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ


## Notes
See 5:10


----------------

# Rom 6:5: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (for if we have been united with him in a death like his)
q: (we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ γὰρ σύμφυτοι γεγόναμεν τῷ ὁμοιώματι τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς ἀναστάσεως ἐσόμεθα


## Notes
See 5:10


----------------

# Rom 6:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (now if we have died with Christ)
q: (we believe that we will also live with him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἀπεθάνομεν σὺν Χριστῷ
* _q1_: πιστεύομεν ὅτι καὶ συζήσομεν αὐτῷ


## Notes
This is another example of p and q being placed together for comparison (see notes on 5:10). 2Ti 2:11 is very similar.


----------------

# Rom 7:2: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (but if her husband dies)
q: (she is released from the law of marriage)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ ἀποθάνῃ ὁ ἀνήρ
* _q1_: κατήργηται ἀπὸ τοῦ νόμου τοῦ ἀνδρός


## Notes
This conditional (and the next two in 7:3) are examples to illustrate the point Paul makes in 7:4-6 about dying to the law. Since we have died we are released from the law


----------------

# Rom 7:3a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (she will be called an adulteress)
p: (if she lives with another man while her husband is alive)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἄρα οὖν ζῶντος τοῦ ἀνδρὸς μοιχαλὶς χρηματίσει
* _p1_: ἐὰν γένηται ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ ἐὰν δὲ ἀποθάνῃ ὁ ἀνήρ


## Notes
Some translations (e.g. NASB, NIV) put p before q: "So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress." (NIV)


----------------

# Rom 7:3b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (but if her husband dies)
q: (she is free from that law)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ ἀποθάνῃ ὁ ἀνήρ
* _q1_: ἐλευθέρα ἐστὶν ἀπὸ τοῦ νόμου


## Notes
In Greek, the last part of v.3 contains a participle verb form γενομένην ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ 'having been joined to a different husband.' ESV, NRSV, and NIV express this as another conditional: "and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress"; NASB expresses this as "though she is joined to another man" and NLT as "when she remarries."


----------------

# Rom 7:7a: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (I would not have known sin)
p: (if it had not been for the law)
(Greek q p order is changed to p q in ESV)


* ESV, NRSV: "if... not"
NASB: "except"
NIV: subject-verb inversion "had it not been"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τὴν ἁμαρτίαν οὐκ ἔγνων
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ διὰ νόμου


## Notes
The phrase εἰ μὴ 'except' is usually treated as a "non-conditional" (see 13:1, 13:8, 14:14) but because mmany English translations have "if not" and the structure is parallel to 7:7b we have included this here.  In some languages, the combination of a negative conditional and inverted order (q before p) may be unnatural. In this case, you could rephrase as "Apart from/Without the law, I would not have known what sin was." Or: "I only knew what sin was because of the law."


----------------

# Rom 7:7b: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (for I would not have known what it is to covet)
p: (if the law had not said, "You shall not covet")


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if... not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τήν τε γὰρ ἐπιθυμίαν οὐκ ᾔδειν
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὁ νόμος ἔλεγεν Οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις


## Notes
The phrase εἰ μὴ is translated as "if... not" rather than as "except" by most English translations. In some languages, the combination of a negative conditional and inverted order (q before p) may be unnatural. In this case, you could rephrase as "It is only because the law had said, "You must not covet" that I knew what it means to covet." Or: "I only knew what it means to covet because the law had said, 'You must not covet.'"


----------------

# Rom 7:16: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (now if I do what I do not want)
q: (I agree with the law, that it is good)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ὃ οὐ θέλω τοῦτο ποιῶ
* _q1_: σύμφημι τῷ νόμῳ ὅτι καλός


## Notes
The truth of p is stated in v.15: "I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate." V.17 could be rephrased, "So since/because I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good."


----------------

# Rom 7:20: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (now if I do what I do not want)
q: (it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ὃ οὐ θέλω τοῦτο ποιῶ
* _q1_: οὐκέτι ἐγὼ κατεργάζομαι αὐτὸ ἀλλὰ ἡ οἰκοῦσα ἐν ἐμοὶ ἁμαρτία


## Notes
This is a repetition - in abbreviated form - of vs.16-17.


----------------

# Rom 8:9a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual / Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (you, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit)
p: (if in fact/since the Spirit of God dwells in you)


* ESV, RSV: "If in fact"
NASB, NIV: "If indeed"
NRSV: "since"
NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐκ ἐστὲ ἐν σαρκὶ ἀλλὰ ἐν πνεύματι
* _p1_: εἴπερ πνεῦμα θεοῦ οἰκεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν


## Notes
The Greek connctive εἴπερ indicates a known fact, and is often translated 'since'. If the order q p is not natural in your language, this can be rephrased as "Since/Because the Spirit of God lives in you(pl), you(pl) are controlled by the Spirit, not by your sinful nature."


----------------

# Rom 8:9b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ)
q: (he does not belong to him) (NASB)


* ESV, NRSV: "anyone who"
NASB, NIV: "if anyone"
NLT: "those who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τις πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ οὐκ ἔχει
* _q1_: οὗτος οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῦ


## Notes
This describes the opposite scenario to the previous (8:9a) conditional. Whereas 8:9a was addressed to all of Paul's readers (the 'you' in Greek is plural) in 8:9b τις 'anyone' and οὗτος 'this one' are singular. This indicates that Paul is simply describing the opposite condition, rather than warning or rebuking his readers.


----------------

# Rom 8:10: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual / Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (but if Christ is in you)
q: (although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: statement "Christ lives within you, so..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν
* _q1_: τὸ μὲν σῶμα νεκρὸν διὰ ἁμαρτίαν τὸ δὲ πνεῦμα ζωὴ διὰ δικαιοσύνην


## Notes
The conditionals in 8:9a, 8:10, and 8:11 all describe the same reality and are all true.


----------------

# Rom 8:11: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual / Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you)
q: (he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: statement "The Spirit of God... lives in you."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ ἐγείραντος τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐκ νεκρῶν οἰκεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν
* _q1_: ὁ ἐγείρας ἐκ νεκρῶν Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν ζῳοποιήσει καὶ τὰ θνητὰ σώματα ὑμῶν διὰ τὸ ἐνοικοῦν αὐτοῦ πνεῦμα ἐν ὑμῖν


## Notes
The conditionals in 8:9a, 8:10, and 8:11 all describe the same reality and are all true.


----------------

# Rom 8:13a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (for if you live according to the flesh)
q: (you will die)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ κατὰ σάρκα ζῆτε
* _q1_: μέλλετε ἀποθνῄσκειν


## Notes
Paul's purpose here is to set out the consequences of living "according to the flesh" rather than to criticize his readers ('you' is plural).


----------------

# Rom 8:13b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body)
q: (you will live)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ πνεύματι τὰς πράξεις τοῦ σώματος θανατοῦτε
* _q1_: ζήσεσθε


## Notes
"In Rom 8:11–12, Paul states that we are not obligated to live according to the flesh now that the Spirit has made us alive. Verse 13 contrasts the two alternatives, establishing explicit states of affairs for the main clauses that follow using conditional frames." [Runge, Steven E. 2010. Discourse Grammar of the Greek New Testament: A Practical Introduction for Teaching and Exegesis. Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.]


----------------

# Rom 8:17a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (and if children)
q: (then heirs)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ τέκνα
* _q1_: καὶ κληρονόμοι


## Notes
The previous verse states the truth of p: "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God" (8:16)


----------------

# Rom 8:17b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
q: (heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ)
p: (if indeed/provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him)


* ESV, RSV: "provided"
NASB, NIV: "if indeed"
NRSV: "if, in fact"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καὶ κληρονόμοι κληρονόμοι μὲν θεοῦ συγκληρονόμοι δὲ Χριστοῦ
* _p1_: εἴπερ συμπάσχομεν ἵνα καὶ συνδοξασθῶμεν


## Notes
The Greek connctive εἴπερ indicates a known fact, and is often translated 'since'; this seems to indicate that Paul assumes that his readers are suffering or have suffered because of their faith in Christ. If a conditional in your language does not allow this interpretation, you could rephrase as "We are not only heirs of God but co-heirs/joint heirs with Christ, because we are suffering with him so that we may also be glorified with him."


----------------

# Rom 8:25: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (but if we hope for what we do not see)
q: (we wait for it with patience)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ὃ οὐ βλέπομεν ἐλπίζομεν
* _q1_: δι ὑπομονῆς ἀπεκδεχόμεθα


## Notes
This expresses an exhortation: If we hope for what we do not see (and we should as Christians) we wait for it with patience (and this is how we should be acting).


----------------

# Rom 8:31: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if God is for us)
q: (who can be against us?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὁ θεὸς ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν
* _q1_: τίς καθ ἡμῶν


## Notes
Q is a rhetorical question that is meant to be answered 'No one!'


----------------

# Rom 9:22: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (what if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction...)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "what if"
NLT: "even though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ θέλων ὁ θεὸς ἐνδείξασθαι τὴν ὀργὴν καὶ γνωρίσαι τὸ δυνατὸν αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: ἤνεγκεν ἐν πολλῇ μακροθυμίᾳ σκεύη ὀργῆς κατηρτισμένα εἰς ἀπώλειαν


## Notes
There is some debate as to whether this is an actual conditional or not, as it has a protasis but no apodosis. This protasis is in the form of a rhetorical question, hence most English translations express εἰ 'if' as "What if". In Greek, the question extends from v.22 through v.24, although NRSV and NIV end it at v.22, and start a new "what if" question at v.23. NASB ends the rhetorical question at v.22 and makes vs.23-24 into a statement. NLT interprets  as concessional 'even if/though': "... even though God has the right to show his anger and his power, he is very patient with those on whom his anger falls, who are destined for destruction."


----------------

# Rom 9:27: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea)
q: (only a remanant of them will be saved)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν ᾖ ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης
* _q1_: τὸ ὑπόλειμμα σωθήσεται


## Notes
This conditional is part of a quote from Isaiah 10:22-23. Here, Ἐὰν has the force of a concessive conditional 'even if/though'.


----------------

# Rom 9:29: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring)
q: (we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah)


* ESV, NRSV, NLT: "if... not"
NASB, NIV: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ μὴ κύριος Σαβαὼθ ἐγκατέλιπεν ἡμῖν σπέρμα
* _q1_: ὡς Σόδομα ἂν ἐγενήθημεν καὶ ὡς Γόμορρα ἂν ὡμοιώθημεν


## Notes
εἰ μὴ 'unless'. This conditional is part of a quote from Isaiah 1:9; p states something that did not happen and q states the consequences of this. This conditional should not be rephrased using an affirmative form.


----------------

# Rom 10:9: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead)
q: (you will be saved)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ὁμολογήσῃς ἐν τῷ στόματί σου κύριον Ἰησοῦν καὶ πιστεύσῃς ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου ὅτι ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸν ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν
* _q1_: σωθήσῃ


## Notes
This conditional applies to any person at any time (so the time orientation is gnomic). In your translation, make sure that it does not sound as if Paul is addressing a single individual only (the verb forms in Greek are 2nd person singular). Paul expands in v.10 using 3rd person singular, which ESV translates as "one": "For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved."


----------------

# Rom 10:15: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (how are they to preach? ~ implies: they can not preach)
p: (unless they are sent = if they are not sent)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "unless"
NLT: "without being sent"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: πῶς δὲ κηρύξωσιν
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἀποσταλῶσιν


## Notes
ἐάν μή 'unless'. The whole conditional is phrased as a rhetorical question that is meant to be answered negatively.
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): And they can preach only if they are sent.
It is best to keep the order Q>P, if possible, because this sentence forms part of a chain starting in v.14: But how are they to call on one in whom they have not BELIEVED? And how are they to BELIEVE in one of whom they have never HEARD? And how are they to HEAR without someone to PROCLAIM him? And how are they to PROCLAIM him unless they are sent? (Note that the subject changes between verses 14 and 15.)


----------------

# Rom 11:6a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (but if it is by grace)
q: (it is no longer on the basis of works)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ χάριτι
* _q1_: οὐκέτι ἐξ ἔργων


## Notes
11:5 makes clear that this is a present time, factual conditional: "So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace." Verse 6 continues with a clarification that includes the non-conditional conjunction ἐπεὶ 'otherwise'.


----------------

# Rom 11:12: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their faliure means riches for the Gentiles)
q: (how much more will their full inclusion mean)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ τὸ παράπτωμα αὐτῶν πλοῦτος κόσμου καὶ τὸ ἥττημα αὐτῶν πλοῦτος ἐθνῶν
* _q1_: πόσῳ μᾶλλον τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῶν


## Notes
The truth of p is asserted in v.11: "through their [the Jews'] trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles.".


----------------

# Rom 11:13-14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p v.13: (I magnify my ministry)
q v.14: (if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them) (NASB)


* ESV: "in order somehow"
NASB: "if somehow"
NRSV: "in order"
NIV: "in the hope that"
NLT: "for I want somehow"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τὴν διακονίαν μου δοξάζω
* _p1_: εἴ πως παραζηλώσω μου τὴν σάρκα καὶ σώσω τινὰς ἐξ αὐτῶν


## Notes
This unusual Greek construction has the conjunction ει (found in class 1 and 3 conditionals) plus the particle πως 'somehow', followed by a subjunctive verb (found in class 2 conditionals).
Q contains a "how much more" statement (see also 5:10, 15, 17, 11:24).


----------------

# Rom 11:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (For if their rejection means reconciliation of the world)
q: (what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἡ ἀποβολὴ αὐτῶν καταλλαγὴ κόσμου
* _q1_: τίς ἡ πρόσλημψις εἰ μὴ ζωὴ ἐκ νεκρῶν


## Notes
Some commentators argue that 'their rejection' refers to God's rejection of Israel, however, in light of vs.11-12 it is more likely to mean Israel's rejection of God.
The word 'but' in "but life from the dead" is a translation of εἰ μὴ 'except'.


----------------

# Rom 11:16a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if the dough offered as firstfruits is holy)
q: (so is the whole lump)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἡ ἀπαρχὴ ἁγία
* _q1_: καὶ τὸ φύραμα


## Notes
There are several interpretations as to what the dough is referring to. The firstfruits of the dough could refer to Abraham and the patriarchs, the remnant of Israel, or Christ. The whole lump could refer to all Israel  or all believers (Kruse). It is best to translate this using a conditional construction that can be used for universal truths, without making any particular interpretation explicit (as NLT does when it adds "since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy, their descendants will also be holy."


----------------

# Rom 11:16b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (and if the root is holy)
q: (so are the branches)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἡ ῥίζα ἁγία
* _q1_: καὶ οἱ κλάδοι


## Notes
There are several interpretations as to what the root is referring to. Suggestions include; the Patriarchs (Abraham in particular), the remnant of Israel, or Christ. The branches could refer to Israel as a whole, the Jewish elect, or all believers (Kruse). It is best to translate this using a conditional construction that can be used for universal truths, without making any particular interpretation explicit.


----------------

# Rom 11:17-18: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past / Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p v.17: (but if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree)
q v.18a: (do not be arrogant toward the branches)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: statements


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δέ τινες τῶν κλάδων ἐξεκλάσθησαν σὺ δὲ ἀγριέλαιος ὢν ἐνεκεντρίσθης ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ συγκοινωνὸς τῆς ῥίζης τῆς πιότητος τῆς ἐλαίας ἐγένου
* _q1_: μὴ κατακαυχῶ τῶν κλάδων


## Notes
The branches that have been broken off represent the Jews who did not believe in Jesus. The command in q (v.18a) is not to be arrogant toward those unbelieving Jews. The verb form translated "do not be arrogant" or "do not boast" is second person singular.


----------------

# Rom 11:18: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Rebuke


## English
p: (if you are arrogant)
q: ([remember that] it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: negative command "you must not brag"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ κατακαυχᾶσαι
* _q1_: οὐ σὺ τὴν ῥίζαν βαστάζεις ἀλλὰ ἡ ῥίζα σέ


## Notes
The Greek simply states, "but if you boast/exult, you do not carry/support the root, but the root you." The verb forms and pronouns translated 'you' here and in vs.21 & 22 are second person singular.


----------------

# Rom 11:21: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (for if God did not spare the natural branches)
q: (neither will he spare you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ὁ θεὸς τῶν κατὰ φύσιν κλάδων οὐκ ἐφείσατο
* _q1_: οὐδὲ σοῦ φείσεται


## Notes
This verse continues the comparison between the Jews (natural branches) and the Gentiles (grafted branches). Verse 21 states. "They [the natural branches] were broken off because of their unbelief..." so we know that p is a knkown fact.


----------------

# Rom 11:22: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Exhort


## English
q: (Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God’s kindness)
p: (if you contine in his kindness) (NASB)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "provided"
NASB, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἴδε οὖν χρηστότητα καὶ ἀποτομίαν θεοῦ ἐπὶ μὲν τοὺς πεσόντας ἀποτομία ἐπὶ δὲ σὲ χρηστότης θεοῦ
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἐπιμένῃς τῇ χρηστότητι


## Notes
Paul is saying that God will be kind to you (singular), but only if you continue to trust in his kindness.
Verse 22 concludes with a warning that includes the non-conditional conjunction ἐπεὶ 'otherwise': "Otherwise you too will be cut off."


----------------

# Rom 11:23: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (and even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief)
q: (will be grafted in)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "if they turn from" (see Notes)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἐπιμένωσι τῇ ἀπιστίᾳ
* _q1_: ἐγκεντρισθήσονται


## Notes
ἐάν μή 'unless'. The fact that the unbelieving Jews have been cut off does not mean that they cannot be grafted back in; being cut off is not a final judgement.
P contains two negative elements: if they do NOT continue in their UNbelief. This could be rephrased as e.g. 'if they turn from their unbelief' (NLT), or 'if they start to believe' (cf. New Century: 'And if the Jews will believe in God again...'; Parole de Vie: 'Mais si un jour, les Juifs acceptent de croire...').


----------------

# Rom 11:24: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree)
q: (how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ σὺ ἐκ τῆς κατὰ φύσιν ἐξεκόπης ἀγριελαίου καὶ παρὰ φύσιν ἐνεκεντρίσθης εἰς καλλιέλαιον
* _q1_: πόσῳ μᾶλλον οὗτοι οἱ κατὰ φύσιν ἐγκεντρισθήσονται τῇ ἰδίᾳ ἐλαίᾳ


## Notes
P describes a known fact; q contains another  "how much more" statement (see also 5:10, 15, 17, 11:12).


----------------

# Rom 12:6: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if prophecy)
q: (in proportion to our faith);


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV, not translated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴτε προφητείαν
* _q1_: κατὰ τὴν ἀναλογίαν τῆς πίστεως


## Notes
The conditionals in vs.6-8 should be understood as a group. The conjunction εἴτε 'if, whether' introduces either a spiritual gift or a person having a certain spiritual gift. It occurs 4 times in vs.6-8; the final 3 types of person are introduced without εἴτε. None of these are complete clauses.
εἴτε introduces prophecy, service, he who teaches, and he who exhorts. Listed afterwards are he who gives, he who leads, and he who shows mercy. 
Each apodosis describes how to use the gift mentioned in p. The first apodosis begins with κατα but after that εν is used. None of these are complete clauses, but some translations (e.g. NIV, NLT) express these as complete clauses.


----------------

# Rom 12:7a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if service) 
q: (in our serving)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV, not translated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴτε διακονίαν
* _q1_: ἐν τῇ διακονίᾳ


## Notes
See 12:6


----------------

# Rom 12:7b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if it is teaching)
q: (then teach) (NIV)


* NIV, NLT: "if"
ESV, NASB, NRSV, not translated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴτε ὁ διδάσκων
* _q1_: ἐν τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ


## Notes
See 12:6


----------------

# Rom 12:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if it is to encourage)
q: (then give encouragement) (NIV)


* NIV, NLT: "if"
ESV, NASB, NRSV, not translated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴτε ὁ παρακαλῶν
* _q1_: ἐν τῇ παρακλήσει


## Notes
See 12:6. The three final gifts in the list (giving, leading, showing mercy) are not introduced by εἴτε but can be translated the same way as the previous gifts if this is more natural in your language.


----------------

# Rom 12:20a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if your enemy is hungry)
q: (feed him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν πεινᾷ ὁ ἐχθρός σου
* _q1_: ψώμιζε αὐτόν


## Notes
Quotes Proverbs 25:22 but omits "and the Lord will reward you". Should be read in light of v21 "do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" and v19 "beloved, never avenge youselves, but leave it to the wrath of God". Paul is challenging his readers to act in kindness with no thought for vengeance.


----------------

# Rom 12:20b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if he is thirsty)
q: (give him something to drink)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν διψᾷ
* _q1_: πότιζε αὐτόν


## Notes
See notes on 12:20a


----------------

# Rom 13:4: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (but if you do wrong)
q: (be afraid)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ τὸ κακὸν ποιῇς
* _q1_: φοβοῦ


----------------

# Rom 13:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (and if there is any other commandment)
q: (it is summed up in this saying "you shall love your neighbor as yourself) (NASB)


* NASB: "if there is any other"
ESV, NRSV: "any other"
NIV: "whatever other"
NLT: "other such"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἑτέρα ἐντολή
* _q1_: ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ ἀνακεφαλαιοῦται ἐν τῷ Ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν


## Notes
εἴ τις 'if any' seems to fuinction as an abbreviation of 'if there is any'


----------------

# Rom 14:8a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (for if we live)
q: (we live to the Lord)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τε γὰρ ζῶμεν
* _q1_: τῷ κυρίῳ ζῶμεν


----------------

# Rom 14:8b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (and if we die)
q: (we die to the Lord)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τε ἀποθνῄσκωμεν
* _q1_: τῷ κυρίῳ ἀποθνῄσκομεν


----------------

# Rom 14:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if your brother is grieved by what you eat)
q: (you are no longer walking in love)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ διὰ βρῶμα ὁ ἀδελφός σου λυπεῖται
* _q1_: οὐκέτι κατὰ ἀγάπην περιπατεῖς


## Notes
This conditional is used to explain the previous verse (discussed in the non-conditional section below). Although Paul has just claimed that nothing is inherently unclean, we need to be aware of how other people view things so as not to 'grieve' them.


----------------

# Rom 14:23: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (the one doubting, if he eats)
q: (he has been condemned) (literal translation)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν φάγῃ
* _q1_: κατακέκριται


## Notes
ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, and NLT all express this as an inverted conditional, e.g. ESV: q: (whoever has doubts is condemned) p: (if he eats). In Greek, p "if he eats" comes between the subject "whoever has doubts" and the rest of q "is condemned".


----------------

# Rom 15:27: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings)
q: (they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ τοῖς πνευματικοῖς αὐτῶν ἐκοινώνησαν τὰ ἔθνη
* _q1_: ὀφείλουσιν καὶ ἐν τοῖς σαρκικοῖς λειτουργῆσαι αὐτοῖς


## Notes
The "saints at Jerusalem" (v.26) are Jews who have believed in Christ. In chapter 11 Paul explained that the Gentiles have received spiritual blessings that were first given to the Jew, and so p expresses a known fact.

# 1 Cor 2:8: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if they had,)
q: (they would not have crucified the Lord of glory)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἔγνωσαν
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν τὸν κύριον τῆς δόξης ἐσταύρωσαν


## Notes
Paul uses a false p and q to prove the truthfulness of the previous statement, "None of the rulers of this age understood this, for..."


----------------

# 1 Cor 3:12-13: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw)
q: (each one's work will become manifest)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τις ἐποικοδομεῖ ἐπὶ τὸν θεμέλιον χρυσόν ἄργυρον λίθους τιμίους ξύλα χόρτον καλάμην
* _q1_: ἑκάστου τὸ ἔργον φανερὸν γενήσεται


## Notes
Greek: εἰ τις "If anyone"
The conditional elaborates on v.10-11 where Paul describes himself as laying the foundation of Jesus Christ, and another is building on this foundation. Grammatically, the time reference of p is present, but we have listed it as gnomic (timeless) because it appears to refer to anyone who has built, is building, or will build; the work of any of these people will eventually "be shown for what it is." (NIV)


----------------

# 1 Cor 3:14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
p: (if the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives)
q: (he will receive a reward)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τινος τὸ ἔργον μενεῖ ὃ ἐποικοδόμησεν
* _q1_: μισθὸν λήμψεται


## Notes
In Greek, this is "If anyone’s work will remain which he built on it, a reward he will receive."
Those who build on the foundation will be tried and tested; the conditionals in v.14 and 15 show the two possible outcomes.


----------------

# 1 Cor 3:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if anyone's work is burned up)
q: (he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τινος τὸ ἔργον κατακαήσεται
* _q1_: ζημιωθήσεται αὐτὸς δὲ σωθήσεται οὕτως δὲ ὡς διὰ πυρός


## Notes
This shows the alternative to v.14.


----------------

# 1 Cor 3:17: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if anyone destroys God's temple)
q: (God will destroy him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις τὸν ναὸν τοῦ θεοῦ φθείρει
* _q1_: φθερεῖ τοῦτον ὁ θεός


----------------

# 1 Cor 3:18: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age)
q: (let him become a fool that he may become wise)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις δοκεῖ σοφὸς εἶναι ἐν ὑμῖν ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ
* _q1_: μωρὸς γενέσθω ἵνα γένηται σοφός


## Notes
The expression εἴ τις δοκεῖ  "If anyone thinks/imagines..." is also used in 8:2 and 14:37.
ESV and NASB follow the Greek and use a 3rd person 'he' throughout; NRSV, NIV, and NLT use 2nd person 'you': "If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise." (NIV)


----------------

# 1 Cor 4:7: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if then you received it)
q: (why do you boast as if you did not receive it?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ καὶ ἔλαβες
* _q1_: τί καυχᾶσαι ὡς μὴ λαβών


## Notes
P presents a known fact (you received everything from God), and q is a rhetorical question that functions as a rebuke (so you should not boast).


----------------

# 1 Cor 4:15: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ)
q: (you do not have many fathers) (NIV)


* ESV: "though you have"
NASB: "if you were to have"
NRSV: "though you might have"
NIV, NLT: "even if you had"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γὰρ μυρίους παιδαγωγοὺς ἔχητε ἐν Χριστῷ
* _q1_: ἀλλ οὐ πολλοὺς πατέρας


## Notes
This is a case of hyperbole; p expresses an extremely high number (μυρίους "countless" is literally 10,000) that is unlikely to be true, but q expresses a statement that is true regardless of p. For this reason, ESV "though you have" is not a good model to follow; a better model is NIV, NLT "even if you had ten thousand..." (Note that the past tense 'had' in English here indicates a non-factual statement, not a past time statement; the time reference is actually present.)
Boyer notes that this has a concessive ('even if') sense even though ἐὰν is not accompanied by the usual και. See also "concessive conditionals" article.


----------------

# 1 Cor 4:19: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
q: (But I will come to you soon)
p: (if the Lord wills)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἐλεύσομαι δὲ ταχέως πρὸς ὑμᾶς
* _p1_: ἐὰν ὁ κύριος θελήσῃ


## Notes
Paul plans and desires to go to the Corinthians, but he remains submissive to God's leading.


----------------

# 1 Cor 5:11: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
q: (But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother)
p: (if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler)


* ESV, NASB, RSV: "if"
NRSV, NIV, NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: νῦν δὲ ἔγραψα ὑμῖν μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἀδελφὸς ὀνομαζόμενος ᾖ πόρνος ἢ πλεονέκτης ἢ εἰδωλολάτρης ἢ λοίδορος ἢ μέθυσος ἢ ἅρπαξ


## Notes
In Greek, ἐὰν 'if' comes before 'one who is called a brother'. A possible alternative translation is: "But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone if he is called a brother and/but is guilty of immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler."


----------------

# 1 Cor 6:2: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future / Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if the world is to be judged by you)
q: (are you incompetent to try trivial cases?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐν ὑμῖν κρίνεται ὁ κόσμος
* _q1_: ἀνάξιοί ἐστε κριτηρίων ἐλαχίστων


## Notes
Third in a line of rhetorical questions rebuking the Corinthians for how they, presumably, have been dealing with conflicts within the church.


----------------

# 1 Cor 6:4: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if you have such cases)
q: (why so you lay them before those who have no standing in the church?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: βιωτικὰ μὲν οὖν κριτήρια ἐὰν ἔχητε
* _q1_: τοὺς ἐξουθενημένους ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τούτους καθίζετε


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:8: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
q: (it is good for them [the unmarried and widows)
p: (if they remain even as I [am]) (NASB)


* NASB: "if"
ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καλὸν αὐτοῖς
* _p1_: ἐὰν μείνωσιν ὡς κἀγώ


## Notes
This could be rephrased without a conditional, as ESV does: ...it is good for them to remain single, as I am.
In Greek, this is the first of a series of conditional sentences (vs.8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15) concerning singleness and marriage.


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Command


## English
p: (But if they cannot exercise self-control)
q: (they should marry)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ οὐκ ἐγκρατεύονται
* _q1_: γαμησάτωσαν


## Notes
This and the previous conditional work together. The first conditional represents Paul's first choice and the second represents another, not as good option, for those who are unable to do the first. The force of the 3rd person imperative γαμησάτωσαν "let them marry" is expressed as an exhortation "they should marry" in most English translations. Note that 3rd person imperative forms are also used in q in vs.11, 12 and 13.


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:11: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Command


## English
p: (but if she does leave)
q: (she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband) (NASB)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ καὶ χωρισθῇ
* _q1_: μενέτω ἄγαμος ἢ τῷ ἀνδρὶ καταλλαγήτω


## Notes
The context pf p is 7:10 "the wife should not separate from her husband". If p happens, q allows two choices. It is not determined which of these must happen, only that no other things should happen.
The force of the 3rd person imperative μενέτω ἄγαμος is understood differently in different translations: NASB and NIV express it as a command "she must remain unmarried", ESV as an exhortation "she should remain unmarried", and NRSV and NLT as an exhortation/concession "let her remain unmarried".


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:12: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Command


## English
p: (if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him)
q: (he should not divorce her)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἀδελφὸς γυναῖκα ἔχει ἄπιστον καὶ αὕτη συνευδοκεῖ οἰκεῖν μετ αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: μὴ ἀφιέτω αὐτήν


## Notes
The "if" here is situational and means "in the case that" (Ellingworth). A non-conditional way to render this is: "Any man whose wife is not a believer but is willing to live with him should not divorce her." In some languages, it may be best to use a more direct, 2nd person form: "If your wife is not a believer, but she is willing  to live with you, you should not divorce her." The negative 3rd person imperative μὴ ἀφιέτω is translated in NASB, NIV and NLT as a command "he must not divorce", and in ESV and NRSV as an exhortation "he should not divorce".


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:13: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Command


## English
p: (if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her)
q: (she should not divorce him)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NASB: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ γυνὴ εἴ τις ἔχει ἄνδρα ἄπιστον καὶ οὗτος συνευδοκεῖ οἰκεῖν μετ αὐτῆς
* _q1_: μὴ ἀφιέτω τὸν ἄνδρα


## Notes
This verse is parallel to v.12 but addresses a believing woman whose husband is not a believer. In some languages and cultures, a woman cannot divorce a man (but a woman can be divorced by a man). In this case, it may be necessary to use a verb such as 'leave'. The force of the command/exhortation should be the same in v.12 and v.13.


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Permit


## English
p: (but if the unbelieving partner seperates)
q: (let it be so)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ὁ ἄπιστος χωρίζεται
* _q1_: χωριζέσθω


## Notes
Paired with the conditionals in 7:12,13 gives the unbeliever the choice - they can stay or they can separate. ESV, NASB and NIV all translate q as "let it be so"; NASB "let him leave" follows the form of the Greek more closely but "him" should be understood as applying to both male and female, which NLT translates using a gender-neutral "them". The force of this 3rd person passive imperative is not a command but rather permission.


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:21b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Permit


## English
p: (but if you can gain your freedom)
q: (avail yourself of that opportunity)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ δύνασαι ἐλεύθερος γενέσθαι
* _q1_: μᾶλλον χρῆσαι


## Notes
The Greek here has εἰ καὶ, but only NRSV translates this as "even if". It is recommended to follow other translations, such as NIV: "although if you can gain your freedom, do so."  Paul is not addressing a particular individual here, so we have listed the probability of p as Neutral.
Boyer suggests that 7:21a could be an implied conditional: "If you were a bondservant when called, do not be concerned about it."


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:28a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Permit


## English
p: (but if you do marry)
q: (you have not sinned)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ καὶ γαμήσῃς
* _q1_: οὐχ ἥμαρτες


## Notes
Most take the pair of conditionals in v.28 to be talking about unmarried men and unmarried women respectively.
The Greek ἐὰν καὶ  could be interpreted as "even if" (a 'concessive conditional'), in which q is not dependent on the validity of p. This interpretation is appropriate if Paul assumes that most of his readers will obey his command in v.27 to "not sek a wife". The ESV, NIV and NLT express a similar idea in English by using the emphatic "if you do marry" rather than the normal "if you marry".


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:28b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Permit


## English
p: (and if a virgin marries)
q: (she has not sinned) (NASB, NIV)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ ἐὰν γήμῃ ἡ παρθένος
* _q1_: οὐχ ἥμαρτεν


## Notes
See 7:28a. NASB, NRSV abd NIV translate παρθένος as "virgin"; ESV translates it as "betrothed woman" and NLT translates it as "young woman".


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:36: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Permit


## English
p1: (if anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed)
p2: (if his passions are strong, and it has to be)
q: (let him do as he wishes: let them marry)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δέ τις ἀσχημονεῖν ἐπὶ τὴν παρθένον αὐτοῦ νομίζει ἐὰν ᾖ ὑπέρακμος καὶ οὕτως ὀφείλει γίνεσθαι
* _q1_: ὃ θέλει ποιείτω οὐχ ἁμαρτάνει γαμείτωσαν


## Notes
This is a complicated sentence because there are two distinct protases (p1 and p2) and q contains two clauses that express basically the same idea.
For p2, "if his passions are strong" is the majority interpretation (ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT); NASB has "if she is past her youth" (see also NET), and in fact interprets τὴν παρθένον αὐτοῦ "the virgin of him" as "his virgin daughter" rather than as "his fiancée".


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:39: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Permit


## English
p: (but if her husband dies)
q: (she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ κοιμηθῇ ὁ ἀνήρ
* _q1_: ἐλευθέρα ἐστὶν ᾧ θέλει γαμηθῆναι μόνον ἐν κυρίῳ


## Notes
This condition describes teh situation when 7:39a no longer applies: "A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives."


----------------

# 1 Cor 7:40: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (she is happier)
p: (if she remains as she is)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: μακαριωτέρα δέ ἐστιν
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὕτως μείνῃ


## Notes
Paul emphasizes that this is his opinion.


----------------

# 1 Cor 8:2: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if anyone imagines that he knows something)
q: (he does not yet know as he ought to know)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV, NLT: "anyone who"
NIV: "those who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις δοκεῖ ἐγνωκέναι τι
* _q1_: οὔπω ἔγνω καθὼς δεῖ γνῶναι


## Notes
εἴ τις 'if anyone'
Similar to 3:18, 14:37 "If anyone thinks/imagines" and Gal 6:3 "if anyone thinks he is something, he deceives himself."
This knowing likely refers to the previous verse which talks about the knowledge which "puffs up". Although they may "know things" it is of little use since it is not use to benefit the body of Christ. There were people in the Corinthian church claiming to have secret knowledge (Ellingworth) so this is at least very likely to be true.


----------------

# 1 Cor 8:3: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (but if anyone loves God)
q: (he is known by God)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV: "anyone"
NIV: "whoever"
NLT: "the person who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τις ἀγαπᾷ τὸν θεόν
* _q1_: οὗτος ἔγνωσται ὑπ αὐτοῦ


## Notes
εἴ τις 'if anyone'


----------------

# 1 Cor 8:5-6: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (even though there may be so-called gods...)
q: (yet for us there is one God...) (NRSV)


* ESV: "although"
NASB, NIV: "even if"
NRSV: "even though"
NLT: "there may be"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ γὰρ εἴπερ εἰσὶν λεγόμενοι θεοὶ εἴτε ἐν οὐρανῷ εἴτε ἐπὶ γῆς ὥσπερ εἰσὶν θεοὶ πολλοὶ καὶ κύριοι πολλοί
* _q1_: ἀλλ ἡμῖν εἷς θεὸς ὁ πατήρ


## Notes
και εἴπερ 'even though' is a concessive conditional, in which q is not dependent on the validity of p. Rather, p describes a situation which emphasizes q by virtue of its exceptional and/or unexpected nature. P states that it is true that there are so-called gods, but indicates that this is of no importance, because for us there is only one God.


----------------

# 1 Cor 8:8a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (we are no worse off)
p: (if we do not eat)


* 


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ φάγωμεν
* _q1_: οὔτε … ὑστερούμεθα


## Notes
ἐάν μή 'if ... not'; in Greek p comes before q, and is introduced by οὔτε 'neither/nor' but most English translations invert p and q.
The negative "if... not" should be kept in translation, if possible, because it forms part of a contrastive pair. If this is not natural, here are two alternatives:
1) use an expression like 'fast' or 'abstain' if your language has this: "If we fast/abstain we are not worse, and if we eat we are not better."
2) combine the two conditionals: "Whether we eat or not makes no difference at all."


----------------

# 1 Cor 8:8b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (and no better of)
p: (if we do)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν φάγωμεν
* _q1_: περισσεύομεν οὔτε


## Notes
This forms a contrastive pair with v.8a. In Greek p comes before q, and is introduced by οὔτε 'neither/nor' ("nor if we eat we are better") but most English translations invert p and q.


----------------

# 1 Cor 8:10: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (for if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple)
q: (will he not be encouraged if his conscience is weak to eat food offered to idols)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γάρ τις ἴδῃ σὲ τὸν ἔχοντα γνῶσιν ἐν εἰδωλείῳ κατακείμενον
* _q1_: οὐχὶ ἡ συνείδησις αὐτοῦ ἀσθενοῦς ὄντος οἰκοδομηθήσεται εἰς τὸ τὰ εἰδωλόθυτα ἐσθίειν


## Notes
Although there is a second 'if' in ESV and NASB it is part of q and is not a conditional in Greek. 
A very literal translation might look like this  "For if anyone should see you the one having knowledge eating in an idol's temple, (might) not his conscience being weak be strengthened to eat food offered to idols." (Trail)


----------------

# 1 Cor 8:13: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Instruct


## English
p: (if food makes my brother stumble)
q: (I will never eat meat)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ βρῶμα σκανδαλίζει τὸν ἀδελφόν μου
* _q1_: οὐ μὴ φάγω κρέα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα


## Notes
Whether the food we eat is likely to cause a fellow believer to stumble will vary for each individual believer. Paul was not a member of the congregation at Corinth where food did cause some believers to stumble, but he describes how he would behave if he were in that situation.


----------------

# 1 Cor 9:2: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if to others I am not an apostle)
q: (at least I am to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "even though"
NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἄλλοις οὐκ εἰμὶ ἀπόστολος
* _q1_: ἀλλά γε ὑμῖν εἰμι


## Notes
Boyer notes that this is one of the instances where the conditional is concessive ('even if') without the use of και. Although p and q are connected, q is true regardless of p.


----------------

# 1 Cor 9:11a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if we have sown spiritual things among you)
q: 11b


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἡμεῖς ὑμῶν τὰ σαρκικὰ θερίσομεν
* _q1_: μέγα εἰ ἡμεῖς ὑμῶν τὰ σαρκικὰ θερίσομεν


## Notes
Q here is the whole conditional statement in 9:11b. The image here is from farming, where seeds are sown and a harvest is reaped.


----------------

# 1 Cor 9:11b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (is it too much)
p: (if we reap material things from you?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: no conditional

* _q1_: μέγα
* _p1_: εἰ ἡμεῖς ὑμῶν τὰ σαρκικὰ θερίσομεν


## Notes
Some English translations express this without a conditional, which avoids having a conditional embedded within a conditional. NET: "is it too much to reap material things from you?" NLT: "aren't we entitled to a harvest of physical food and drink?"

# 1 Cor 9:12a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (If others share this rightful claim on you)
q: (do not we even more?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἄλλοι τῆς ὑμῶν ἐξουσίας μετέχουσιν
* _q1_: οὐ μᾶλλον ἡμεῖς


## Notes
Elaborating on the previous verse, Paul reminds his readers in p that they have supported other preachers, and asks in q (using a rhetorical question) whether he and his companions do not deserve to be supported as well.


----------------

# 1 Cor 9:16a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (If I preach the gospel)
q: (that gives me no ground for boasting)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "when"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γὰρ εὐαγγελίζωμαι
* _q1_: οὐκ ἔστιν μοι καύχημα


## Notes
This is something Paul is doing, so NIV has: "when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast"


----------------

# 1 Cor 9:16b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (Woe to me)
p: (if I do [did] not preach the gospel)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐαὶ γάρ μοί ἐστιν
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ εὐαγγελίσωμαι


## Notes
The negative conditional ἐάν μή 'if ... not' should be kept if possible, as this is the negative counterpart to the affirmative conditional in the first part of the verse. (Note that the affirmative conditional is factual - Paul is proclaiming the gospel, but the negative conditional is non-factual.) 
It may be more natural to put p before q: "If I didn't proclaim the gospel, it would be so terrible for me."
In some languages, 'not proclaim' can be expressed as 'fail to proclaim': "If I were to fail to proclaim the good news, it would be so terrble for me."

## English
p: (for if I do this of my own will)
q: (I have a reward)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἑκὼν τοῦτο πράσσω
* _q1_: μισθὸν ἔχω


## Notes
9:17 contains two conditionals that describe two situations - the first (v.17a) false, the second (v.17b) true.


----------------

# 1 Cor 9:17b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (but if not of my own will)
q: (I am still entrusted with a stewardship)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἄκων
* _q1_: οἰκονομίαν πεπίστευμαι


## Notes
9:16a shows that this conditional is factual as Paul wrote "I am compelled to preach" (NIV).

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις καλεῖ ὑμᾶς τῶν ἀπίστων καὶ θέλετε πορεύεσθαι

* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἐγὼ χάριτι μετέχω
* _q1_: τί βλασφημοῦμαι ὑπὲρ οὗ ἐγὼ εὐχαριστῶ

## English
p: (for if a woman does not cover her head)
q: (let her also have her hair cut off) (NASB)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ οὐ κατακαλύπτεται γυνή
* _q1_: καὶ κειράσθω


## Notes
It would have been shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or cut short, in both Jewish and Greek society, so Paul is issuing a strong rebuke to women who do not cover their heads while praying. NIV expresses this naturally in English as "For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off."
ESV translates γυνή as "wife" butthe other translations all have "woman".

p: (but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved)
q: (let her cover her head) (NASB)


* ESV, NLT: "since"
NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ αἰσχρὸν γυναικὶ τὸ κείρασθαι ἢ ξυρᾶσθαι
* _q1_: κατακαλυπτέσθω


## Notes
Here Paul makes the same point as in v.6a, but he starts with the (then) commonly accepted truth that it was shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or cut short in p; q is an imperative and has the force of a command.

## English
p: (but if we judged ourselves truly)
q: (we would not be judged)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἑαυτοὺς διεκρίνομεν
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν ἐκρινόμεθα


## Notes
In v.29 Paul has stated that some have been judged, so p is not true.


----------------

# 1 Cor 11:34: First Class Condition

## English
p: (if anyone is hungry)

NIV: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις πεινᾷ
* _q1_: ἐν οἴκῳ ἐσθιέτω


## Notes
This has ben interpreted as, "if anyone is so hungry that he cannot wait for everyone to arrive, he should eat at home" (Hatton) or "if you want to gorge yourselves... eat at home" (Fee)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν εἴπῃ ὁ πούς Ὅτι οὐκ εἰμὶ χείρ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἐκ τοῦ σώματος
* _q1_: οὐ παρὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ τοῦ σώματος


## Notes
This is the first of a series of conditionals in which Paul develops the metaphor of the church as a body.

* _p1_: εἴτε πάσχει ἓν μέλος
* _q1_: συμπάσχει πάντα τὰ μέλη


## Notes
In Greek the form of both conditionals in v.26 is εἴτε, indicating that they are complimentary and should be understood together.

## English
p: (if I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love)
q: (I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐὰν ταῖς γλώσσαις τῶν ἀνθρώπων λαλῶ καὶ τῶν ἀγγέλων ἀγάπην δὲ μὴ ἔχω
* _q1_: γέγονα χαλκὸς ἠχῶν ἢ κύμβαλον ἀλαλάζον

# 1 Cor 13:2: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p1: (and if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge [...but have not love])
p2: (and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love)
q: (I am nothing)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἔχω προφητείαν καὶ εἰδῶ τὰ μυστήρια πάντα καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γνῶσιν
* _p2_: ἐὰν ἔχω πᾶσαν τὴν πίστιν ὥστε ὄρη μεθιστάναι
* _q1_: οὐθέν εἰμι


## Notes
This verse has a complex protasis consisting of three positive statements (1) I have prophecy, (2) I know all mysteries and all knowledge, (3) I have all faith so as to remove mountains; in Greek, ἐὰν 'if' occurs before (1) and (3). Most English translations follow the Greek and use "if" twice, but NLT uses "if" before all three statements. In some languages, it may be more natural to only have one conditional markerfor all three statements. These positive statements are followed by one negative statement "but love I do not have", which overrides the positive statements; in Greek there is emphasis on "love" (which is fronted).


----------------

# 1 Cor 13:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p1: (if I give away all I have [...but have not love])
p2: (and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love)
q: (I gain nothing)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ψωμίσω πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντά μου
* _p2_: ἐὰν ψωμίσω πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντά μου καὶ ἐὰν παραδῶ τὸ σῶμά μου ἵνα
* _q1_: οὐδὲν ὠφελοῦμαι


## Notes
This verse has a complex protasis consisting of two positive statements (1) I give away all my possessions, (2) I surrender my body to be burned. In Greek, p1 has κἂν and p2 has καὶ ἐὰν both of which can be understood either as 'even if or 'and if', but no English translation translates these as concessives (except KJV & NKJV which use "though"). Most English translations follow the Greek and use "if" twice, but NIV and NLT only use "if" once. As with 13:2, these positive statements are followed by one negative statement "but love I do not have", which overrides the positive statements; in Greek there is emphasis on "love" (which is fronted).

* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic

## English
q: (The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues)
p: (unless someone [he] interprets)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: μείζων δὲ ὁ προφητεύων ἢ ὁ λαλῶν γλώσσαις
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ διερμηνεύῃ


## Notes
εἰ μὴ 'if not' is modified by ἐκτὸς 'except'. This phrase is only used two other times:1 Cor 15:2b and 1Ti 5:19.
The subject of "interprets" is either "someone" (ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT) or "he", i.e. the one who speaks in tongues (NASB, ASV, NET, REB).
If a translation of of "unless", "except if", or "if not" is unclear or unnatural in your language, this can be rephrased as an affirmative with 'only': "The one who speaks in tongues is only greater than the one who prophesies if he/someone interprets what he has said."

# 1 Cor 14:6a: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic

## English
p: (if I come to you speaking in tongues)
q: (14:6b)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἔλθω πρὸς ὑμᾶς γλώσσαις λαλῶν
* _q1_: τί ὑμᾶς ὠφελήσω ἐὰν μὴ ὑμῖν λαλήσω ἢ ἐν ἀποκαλύψει ἢ ἐν γνώσει ἢ ἐν προφητείᾳ ἢ ἐν διδαχῇ


## Notes
Q is the whole of 14:6b, which is itself a conditional. If necessary, this could be broken up into two separate sentences: (6a) "if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will this benefit you? (6b) It will not benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching."

## English
q: (how will I benefit you ~ implies: I will not benefit you)
p: (unless I bring you [= if I do not bring you] some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "unless"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τί ὑμᾶς ὠφελήσω
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ὑμῖν λαλήσω ἢ ἐν ἀποκαλύψει ἢ ἐν γνώσει ἢ ἐν προφητείᾳ ἢ ἐν διδαχῇ


## Notes
This conditional functions as q of the conditional 'if I come to you speaking in tongues' in 14:6a. 
Paraphrase (for languages without 'unless' or 'except'); this breaks the verse into two separate sentences, and makes the negative conditional into an affirmative: "I will benefit you only if I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching."
NLT provides an alternative structure: "Dear brothers and sisters, if I should (or: were to) come to you speaking in an unknown language, how would that help you? But if I bring you a revelation or some special knowledge or prophecy or teaching, that will be helpful."

## English
It is the same way with lifeless instruments that produce sound, such as the flute or the harp
p: (If they do not give distinct notes,)
q: ( how will anyone know what is being played?) (NRSV)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if... not"
NIV: "unless"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν διαστολὴν τοῖς φθόγγοις μὴ δῷ
* _q1_: πῶς γνωσθήσεται τὸ αὐλούμενον ἢ τὸ κιθαριζόμενον


## Notes
ἐάν...μή 'if... not', 'unless'
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): 'Consider lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp; only if they produce clear notes will a person recognize the melody.'
The question "how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp?" expects a negative answer: "It will not be known."

## Notes
Note that 14:7b, 8, 9 are making basically the same argument. 14:7b & 8 provide illustrations, and 14:9 provides the application.

NASB, NIV: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ εὔσημον λόγον δῶτε

## Notes
ἐάν μή 'if ... not', 'unless'
Paraphrase avoiding rhetorical question: "If the tongue does not speak words that people understand, no one will know what is said."
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "Only if the tongue speaks understandable words will people know what is said."
NLT expresses thisas: "If you speak to people in words they don’t understand, how will they know what you are saying?"

p: (if anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual)
q: (he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "if anyone"
NRSV: "anyone who"
NLT: "if you"

# 1 Cor 15:2a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: ([the gospel] by which you are being saved)
p: (if you hold fast the word which I preached to you)


* 


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: δι οὗ καὶ σῴζεσθε τίνι λόγῳ εὐηγγελισάμην ὑμῖν
* _p1_: εἰ κατέχετε


## Notes
P is a continuation of v.1: "the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, (2) and by which also you are being saved"; however, only "being saved" is dependent on "holding firmly to the message I proclaimed", and so it may be best to start a new sentence here, as NIV does: "By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you."


----------------

# 1 Cor 15:2b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely / Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (implied: you are being saved by the gospel)
p: (unless you believed in vain)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "unless" 
NIV: "otherwise"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ εἰκῇ ἐπιστεύσατε


## Notes
εἰ μὴ 'if not' is modified by ἐκτὸς 'except'. This phrase is only used two other times:1 Cor 14:5b and 1Ti 5:19.
NIV is a good model: "By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain." This is saying "If this is not true (i.e. you are not saved by the gospel), then you have believed for no reason." 
An alternative interpretation treats 'if you hold fast...' and 'unless you believed in vain' as two parallel conditions for 'you are saved by the gospel'. An example of this interpretation is NLT: "It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you—unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place." (Or: "... unless you never believed it in the forstplace."

# 1 Cor 15:12: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual

## English
p: (now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead)
q: (how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δὲ Χριστὸς κηρύσσεται ὅτι ἐκ νεκρῶν ἐγήγερται
* _q1_: πῶς λέγουσιν ἐν ὑμῖν τινες ὅτι ἀνάστασις νεκρῶν οὐκ ἔστιν


## Notes
The conditionals in 15:12-19 belong to the same argument and build on each other. Often they take q of the previous conditional (perhaps slightly modified) and use it as p of the new conditional. From v.13 on the protases are false, and so the corresponding apodoses are also false.
The time reference in v.12 refers to "is being proclaimed" not to "raised from the dead".

# 1 Cor 15:13: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual

## English
p: (but if there is no resurrection of the dead)
q: (then not even Christ has been raised)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἀνάστασις νεκρῶν οὐκ ἔστιν
* _q1_: οὐδὲ Χριστὸς ἐγήγερται


## Notes
See note on 15:12. 
The two negatives (in p and q) plus the fact that this is non-factual may cause difficulties in some languages. Lyman (1975) noted the following rendering in a Zapotec translation: “If it is true that the dead do not come back to life, then we cannot say that Christ came back to life.”

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὅλως νεκροὶ οὐκ ἐγείρονται

## Notes
The rhetorical question of q implies that this is something the people of Corinth are doing. However, it does not mean that Paul is condoning or encouraging the practice.

NLT: "even when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴτε δὲ θλιβόμεθα
* _q1_: ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑμῶν παρακλήσεως καὶ σωτηρίας


## Notes
Both εἴτε conditionals in v.6 should be understood as a group. Together they encompass the spectrum of reality. In either situation, the result is comfort for the Corinthians. See also "ειτε conditional marker" article. 
Vs.4-5 make it clear that Paul and Timothy were afflicted/troubled.

* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἐγὼ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς
* _q1_: καὶ τίς ὁ εὐφραίνων με εἰ μὴ ὁ λυπούμενος ἐξ ἐμοῦ


## Notes
In v.1 Paul refers to his last visit to the Corinthians and the pain it caused. He had decided not to visit again so as to avoid further pain (NASB "sorrow), and so we have rated the probability of p Very Likely.

# 2 Cor 2:5: First Class Condition

## English
p: (if anyone has caused pain)

* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: paraphrased in a relative clause


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δέ τις λελύπηκεν
* _q1_: οὐκ ἐμὲ λελύπηκεν ἀλλὰ ἀπὸ μέρους ἵνα μὴ ἐπιβαρῶ πάντας ὑμᾶς


## Notes
ει τις "if anyone"
Similarly to 2:2, Paul is discussing the specific problems in Corinth and almost certainly has a specific person in mind. The NLT translates in such a way that makes this explicit

# 2 Cor 2:10: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I have forgiven anything)
q: (what I have forgiven has been for your sake in the presence of Christ)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "whatever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τι κεχάρισμαι
* _q1_: καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ ὃ κεχάρισμαι … δι ὑμᾶς ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ


## Notes
εἴ τι 'if anything', 'whatever' (see Mat 18:28; 2Co 7:14, 1Ti 1:10). 
P "if I have fogiven anything" constitutes a parenthetical thought, occurring between two halves of its apodosis. Most English translations separate this off from the rest of the sentence with commas, dashes or brackets.
In this speech act conditional q is true regardless of the truth of p. Translator's Notes (Miller and Martens 2016) describe two possible interpretations of this verse, and encourage a translation that allows for either interpretation. Either the sin was not against Paul personally, so his forgiveness was not really required, or the sin was a small problem and easy to forgive (i.e. it was no longer a problem because the person had repented).

NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δὲ ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου ἐν γράμμασιν ἐντετυπωμένη λίθοις ἐγενήθη ἐν δόξῃ ὥστε μὴ δύνασθαι ἀτενίσαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον Μωϋσέως διὰ τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ τὴν καταργουμένην
* _q1_: πῶς οὐχὶ μᾶλλον ἡ διακονία τοῦ πνεύματος ἔσται ἐν δόξῃ


## Notes
Paul compares the glory of the old covenant with the glory of the new convenant by using a factual conditional in v.7 and a rhetorical question that expects a "yes" answer in v.8. This conditional and the following two (v.9 and v.11) have essentially the same message stated three different ways: the new convenant is far more glorious than the old covenant.

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ τὸ καταργούμενον διὰ δόξης
* _q1_: πολλῷ μᾶλλον τὸ μένον ἐν δόξῃ


## Notes
Paul once more continues his arguement for the superior glory of the new covanent this time by comparing their durations. The old covanent was "fading away" while the other was permanent. See also note at v.7-8

# 2 Cor 4:3: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present

p: (even if our gospel is veiled)
q: (it is veiled to those who are perishing)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "even if"
NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ καὶ ἔστιν κεκαλυμμένον τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν
* _q1_: ἐν τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις ἐστὶν κεκαλυμμένον


## Notes
εἰ καὶ 'if indeed', 'even if'
The force of this conditional is expressed well by NLT: "If the Good News we preach is hidden behind a veil, it is hidden only from people who are perishing."

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ ὁ ἔξω ἡμῶν ἄνθρωπος διαφθείρεται
* _q1_: ἀλλ ὁ ἔσω ἡμῶν ἀνακαινοῦται ἡμέρᾳ καὶ ἡμέρᾳ


## Notes
εἰ καὶ 'if indeed', 'even if', 'although'
This is a concessive conditional in which q is not dependent on the validity of p. Rather, p describes a situation which emphasizes q by virtue of its exceptional and/or unexpected nature. While it is grammatically a conditional in Greek, the reality of p means that most English translations use "though".

# 2 Cor 5:1: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely

## English
p: (if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ
* _q1_: οἰκοδομὴν ἐκ θεοῦ ἔχομεν


## Notes
Though the NLT has "when" here, implying a Factual condition, it is more likely that Paul was leaving the condition open to the possibility of not occurring. Paul writes in more than one of his letters that the return of Christ is not known and some believers may not see death.

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ ἐγνώκαμεν κατὰ σάρκα Χριστόν
* _q1_: ἀλλὰ νῦν οὐκέτι γινώσκομεν


## Notes
εἰ καὶ 'if indeed', 'even if', 'although'
This is a concessive conditional in which q is not dependent on the validity of p. Rather, p describes a situation which emphasizes q by virtue of its exceptional and/or unexpected nature. While it is grammatically a conditional in Greek, the reality of p means that most English translations use "though".

NLT: "anyone who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὥστε εἴ τις ἐν Χριστῷ
* _q1_: καινὴ κτίσις


## Notes
εἴ τις 'if anyone'
Paul makes a general statement here that is not referencing a particular person nor a specific probability. He does, however say this to encourage the Corinthian church, whom he did consider to be "in Christ".

* _p1_: εἰ καὶ ἐλύπησα ὑμᾶς ἐν τῇ ἐπιστολῇ
* _q1_: οὐ μεταμέλομαι


## Notes
εἰ καὶ 'if indeed', 'even if', 'although'
There are 3 occurrences of εἰ και in verse 8. Boyer and Martin both analyze them as 3 separate concessive conditionals, in which  q is not dependent on the validity of p. Rather, p describes a situation which emphasizes q by virtue of its exceptional and/or unexpected nature.

* _p1_: εἰ καὶ μετεμελόμην
* _q1_: νῦν χαίρω


## Notes
See note on v.8a 
There are two interpretations of this conditional; in both, εἰ καὶ is factual and so all 5 English translations use "though".
ESV, NRSV, and NLT interpret "though I did regret it" as contrasting with "I do not regret it". NLT expresses this well: "I am not sorry that I sent that severe letter to you, though I was sorry at first..." 
NRSV, NIV, and Martin interpret this conditional as spanning v.8-9, with conditional 8c being a parenthetical thought in the middle of this one. The NIV's division and punctuation of the clauses in these verses reflects this interpretation well: "Though I did regret it... (9) yet now I am happy..."

# 2 Cor 7:8c: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (that letter grieved you)
p: (though only for a while)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "though only"
NIV: "but only"
NLT: no condtional or concessive


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἐκείνη … ἐλύπησεν ὑμᾶς
* _q1_: εἰ καὶ πρὸς ὥραν


## Notes
See note on v.8a 
In Greek, p comes in the middle of q. A word-for-word translation with p in square brackets is: "I see that that letter [though (if only)] for an hour] it grieved you(pl)."


----------------

# 2 Cor 7:12: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Encourage


## English
p: (although I wrote to you)
q: (it was not for the sake  of the one who did wrong, nor the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God)


* ESV, RSV, NASB: "although"
NIV: "even though"
NLT: no conditional or concessive


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ ἔγραψα ὑμῖν οὐχ ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἀδικήσαντος οὐδὲ ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἀδικηθέντος
* _q1_: οὐχ ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἀδικήσαντος οὐδὲ ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἀδικηθέντος ἀλλ ἕνεκεν τοῦ φανερωθῆναι τὴν σπουδὴν ὑμῶν τὴν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ


## Notes
εἰ καὶ 'if indeed', 'even if', 'although'
Because p is factual and is followed by a negative, most English translations use "although" here. NLT expresses the force of this construction well: "My purpose, then, was not to write about who did the wrong or who was wronged. I wrote to you so that in the sight of God you could see for yourselves how loyal you are to us."


----------------

# 2 Cor 7:14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (whatever boasts I made to him about you,
q: (I was not put to shame) (ESV)

p: (if in anything I have boasted to him about you,)
q: (I was not put to shame) (NASB)


* NASB, NRSV: "if"
ESV: "whatever"
NIV, NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τι αὐτῷ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν κεκαύχημαι
* _q1_: οὐ κατῃσχύνθην


## Notes
εἴ τι 'if anything', 'whatever'
In p Paul admits that he boasted to Titus about the Corinthian believers and in q he states that this boasting was justified.


----------------

# 2 Cor 8:12a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if the readiness is there)
q: (it is acceptable)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "if" (2nd person, inverted)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἡ προθυμία πρόκειται
* _q1_: εὐπρόσδεκτος


## Notes
Paul phrases this in a very general way, but he clearly intends to refer to the Corinthians' readiness to give and the acceptability of the gift. As a general principle the probility is neutral and the time is gnomic. But if you translate this as referring specifically to the Corinthians (as in NLT: "Whatever you give is acceptable, if you give it eagerly.") the probility will be likely and the time will be future.


----------------

# 2 Cor 9:4: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready)
q: (we would be humiliated--to say nothing of you-- for being so confident.


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if" 
NLT: "if" (inverted)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: μή πως ἐὰν ἔλθωσιν σὺν ἐμοὶ Μακεδόνες καὶ εὕρωσιν ὑμᾶς ἀπαρασκευάστους
* _q1_: καταισχυνθῶμεν ἡμεῖς ἵνα μὴ λέγωμεν ὑμεῖς ἐν τῇ ὑποστάσει ταύτῃ


## Notes
Paul refers to this possible future circumstance and its outcome. P has two parts: 1) some Macedonians coming with Paul, and 2) the Macedonians finding that the Corinthians are not ready. (1) is likely to happen, but (2) is unlikely (or Paul hopes that it is unlikely).


----------------

# 2 Cor 10:7: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if anyone is confident that he is Christ's)
q: (let him remind himself that just as he is Christ's, so also are we)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if" 
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις πέποιθεν ἑαυτῷ Χριστοῦ εἶναι
* _q1_: τοῦτο λογιζέσθω πάλιν ἐφ ἑαυτοῦ ὅτι καθὼς αὐτὸς Χριστοῦ οὕτως καὶ ἡμεῖς


## Notes
P has εἴ τις 'if anyone' but Paul has specific people in mind (his opponents at Corinth), hence NRSV translates: "If you are confident that you belong to Christ, remind yourself of this, that just as you belong to Christ, so also do we."
.


----------------

# 2 Cor 10:8: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (even if I boast a little too much of our authority...)
q: (I will not be ashamed)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "even if" 
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τε γὰρ περισσότερόν τι καυχήσωμαι περὶ τῆς ἐξουσίας ἡμῶν ἧς ἔδωκεν ὁ κύριος εἰς οἰκοδομὴν καὶ οὐκ εἰς καθαίρεσιν ὑμῶν
* _q1_: οὐκ αἰσχυνθήσομαι


## Notes
Based on the context, this this can be interpreted as a concessive ("even if") conditional, in which q is not dependent on the truth of p.


----------------

# 2 Cor 11:4: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
square brackets indicate material added in the ESV for naturalness in English:
p1: (if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed,) 
p2: (or [if] you receive a different spirit from the one you received,)
p3: (or [if you accept] a different gospel from the one you accepted)
q: (you put up with it readily enough)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if" 
NLT: "even if" (inverted)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὲν γὰρ ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἄλλον Ἰησοῦν κηρύσσει ὃν οὐκ ἐκηρύξαμεν ἢ πνεῦμα ἕτερον λαμβάνετε ὃ οὐκ ἐλάβετε ἢ εὐαγγέλιον ἕτερον ὃ οὐκ ἐδέξασθε
* _q1_: καλῶς ἀνέχεσθε


## Notes
There are three parts to p; although there is only one εἰ 'if' in Greek, most English translations repeat "if".


----------------

# 2 Cor 11:6: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (even if I am unskilled in speaking)
q: (I am not so in knowledge)


* ESV, NASB: "even if" 
NRSV, NIV, NLT: "I may (indeed) be... but"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ καὶ ἰδιώτης τῷ λόγῳ
* _q1_: ἀλλ οὐ τῇ γνώσει


## Notes
εἰ δὲ καὶ 'even if'
Paul seems to be accepting the description of himself in p (perhaps ironically), but he states that even so he is certainly not lacking knowledge of the truth.


----------------

# 2 Cor 11:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
q: (it is no surprise)
p: (if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if" 
NLT: no conditional ("it is no wonder that...")


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐ μέγα
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ οἱ διάκονοι αὐτοῦ μετασχηματίζονται ὡς διάκονοι δικαιοσύνης


## Notes
Paul gives a harsh warning to the Corinthians and a rebuke to the decievers, linking them with the deceit of Satan himself.


----------------

# 2 Cor 11:16: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Request


## English
p: (but even if you do [think me foolish])
q: (accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little)


* ESV, NIV, NLT: "even if"
NASB, NRSV: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή γε
* _q1_: κἂν ὡς ἄφρονα δέξασθέ με ἵνα κἀγὼ μικρόν τι καυχήσωμαι


## Notes
Greek has two expressions that include conditional particles: εἰ δὲ μή γε 'otherwise' and καν 'even if'. Most English translations express this as "But (even) if you do...".


----------------

# 2 Cor 11:20: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
q: (you bear it) 
p: (if someone makes slaves of you, 
or [if someone] devours you, 
or [if someone] takes advantage of you, 
or [if someone] puts on airs, 
or [if someone] strikes you in the face)


* ESV: "if someone" for first clause, "or" for next four
NASB: "if anyone" for first clause, "anyone" for next four
NRSV: "when someone" for first clause, "or" for next four
NIV: "even...anyone who" for first clause, "or" for next four
NLT: "when someone" only for first clause


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἀνέχεσθε
* _p1_: εἴ τις ὑμᾶς καταδουλοῖ εἴ τις κατεσθίει εἴ τις λαμβάνει εἴ τις ἐπαίρεται εἴ τις εἰς πρόσωπον ὑμᾶς δέρει


## Notes
In the Greek, each clause listed in p is is introduced by its own ει τις 'if anyone'. Paul presents these as a list of ways in which the "false apostles" (v.13) have taken advantage of the Corinthian believers, so these are factual; note that NRSV and NLT translate p using "when".


----------------

# 2 Cor 11:30: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I must boast)
q: (I will boast of the things that show my weakness)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ καυχᾶσθαι δεῖ
* _q1_: τὰ τῆς ἀσθενείας μου καυχήσομαι


## Notes
P is factual because Paul states in 12:1 that it is necessary for him to boast (even though this will do no good).


----------------

# 2 Cor 12:6: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I should wish to boast)
q: (I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "if"
NIV: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γὰρ θελήσω καυχήσασθαι
* _q1_: οὐκ ἔσομαι ἄφρων ἀλήθειαν γὰρ ἐρῶ


## Notes
P is non-factual because Paul does not want to boast. However, if he did boast about himself, it would be justified, unlike his opponents who likely were making false claims about themselves.


----------------

# 2 Cor 12:11b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (I was not at all inferior to these super apostles)
p: (even though I am nothing)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "even though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐδὲν γὰρ ὑστέρησα τῶν ὑπερλίαν ἀποστόλων
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ οὐδέν εἰμι


## Notes
εἰ καὶ 'even if', 'even though'
This is a "concessive conditional," in which q is not dependent on the validity of p. Typically, in concessive clauses, p expressess an unexpectedor extreme idea which emphasizes the point made in q. This hyperbole serves to emphasize Christ’s working in Paul’s weakness.


----------------

# 2 Cor 12:15b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if I love you more)
q: (am I to be loved less?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "even though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ περισσοτέρως ὑμᾶς ἀγαπῶν
* _q1_: ἧσσον ἀγαπῶμαι


----------------

# 2 Cor 13:2b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if I come again)
q: (I will not spare them)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NLT, NIV: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἔλθω εἰς τὸ πάλιν
* _q1_: οὐ φείσομαι


## Notes
In 13:1 Paul mentions his third visit to Corinth as if it has already been arranged, so it seems that Paul is using ἐὰν 'if' to mean "when" here. NIV translates this idea as "On my return..." and NLT as "that next time..."


----------------

# 2 Cor 13:5b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
q: (Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?)
p: (unless indeed you fail to meet the test!)


* ESV, NASB, RSV: "unless indeed"
NIV: "unless, of course"
NLT: "if not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἢ οὐκ ἐπιγινώσκετε ἑαυτοὺς ὅτι Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν
* _p1_: εἰ μήτι ἀδόκιμοί ἐστε


## Notes
εἰ μήτι 'unless'
Q is in the form of a question, and precedes p (UBS Greek, ESV, NRSV all put the question mark after q; e.g. NRSV: Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you?)
In some languages, the combination of the inverted order q then p, plus the fact the q is a question may mean that this conditional needs to be restructured. One option is to repeat the final part of q: "Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? He is certainly in you, if you have not failed the test."
The phrase "fail the test" is a translation of the Greek word ἀδόκιμοι which can also mean 'not genuine', 'discrdited', or 'not approved'. An alternative translation avoiding a double negative in p is: "Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? He is certainly in you, if your faith is genuine."


----------------

# Gal 1:8: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you)
q: (let him be accursed)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NASB: "even if"
NLT: Let God’s curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ ἐὰν ἡμεῖς ἢ ἄγγελος ἐξ οὐρανοῦ εὐαγγελίζηται ὑμῖν παρ ὃ εὐηγγελισάμεθα ὑμῖν
* _q1_: ἀνάθεμα ἔστω


## Notes
καὶ ἐὰν expresses a concessive conditional. Paul is saying that anyone who preaches a different gospel should be cursed (implied: by God), and that this applies even to Paul or an angel from heaven.


----------------

# Gal 1:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received)
q: (let him be accursed)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ὑμᾶς εὐαγγελίζεται παρ ὃ παρελάβετε
* _q1_: ἀνάθεμα ἔστω


## Notes
Given that Paul wrote in v.6 that the Galatians "are turning to a different gospel" the situation in p is factual. Using a conditional sentence allows Paul to curse them indirectly rather than directly.


----------------

# Gal 1:10: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if I were still trying to please man)
q: (I would not be a servant of God)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἔτι ἀνθρώποις ἤρεσκον
* _q1_: Χριστοῦ δοῦλος οὐκ ἂν ἤμην


## Notes
We know that Paul is a servant of Christ, so p cannot be true


----------------

# Gal 2:14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not a Jew)
q: (how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: no conditional
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ σὺ Ἰουδαῖος ὑπάρχων ἐθνικῶς καὶ οὐκ Ἰουδαϊκῶς ζῇς
* _q1_: πῶς τὰ ἔθνη ἀναγκάζεις Ἰουδαΐζειν


## Notes
Paul is reminding Peter that he had been living like a Gentile. The phrase “though a Jew” is embedded within p, and as Groff (2016) Translator’s Notes suggests, can be moved to the start of the sentence if this is more natural.


----------------

# Gal 2:17: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (but if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners)
q: (is Christ then a servant of sin?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "suppose"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ζητοῦντες δικαιωθῆναι ἐν Χριστῷ εὑρέθημεν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἁμαρτωλοί ἆρα Χριστὸς ἁμαρτίας διάκονος
* _q1_: ἆρα Χριστὸς ἁμαρτίας διάκονος


## Notes
In p, Paul may be referring to the fact that the circumcision faction regarded him and his associates as no better than Gentile sinners, or he may mean that when he and other Jews put their faith purely in Christ, they realized that they too were sinners. The rhetorical question in q is meant to be answered "certainly not!"


----------------

# Gal 2:18: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if I rebuild what I tore down)
q: (I prove myself to be a transgressor)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἃ κατέλυσα ταῦτα πάλιν οἰκοδομῶ
* _q1_: παραβάτην ἐμαυτὸν συνιστάνω


## Notes
The "building" which Paul describes himself rebuilding or tearing down is the Jewish law.


----------------

# Gal 2:21: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue / Rebuke


## English
p: (for if righteousness were through the law)
q: (then Christ died for no purpose)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη
* _q1_: ἄρα Χριστὸς δωρεὰν ἀπέθανεν


## Notes
There is no verb in p, so it is not possible to determine whether this is a first or second class conditional. The non-factual interpretation is the typical meaning of a second class conditional, and Paul has already made it clear that righteousness does not come through the law (see 2:16). First class conditionals are used to present situations as “true for the sake of argument”, which also applies here. The conditional reinforces Paul’s claim that righteousness does not come through the law, and it also functions to rebuke to those in the circumcision faction who insist that keeping the law is still necessary.


----------------

# Gal 3:4: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
NRSV:
Did you experience so much for nothing?
p: (- if it really was for nothing)


* ESV, NASB: "if indeed"
NRSV, NIV: "if... really"
NLT: "Surely it was not in vain, was it?"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τοσαῦτα ἐπάθετε εἰκῇ
* _p1_: εἴ γε καὶ εἰκῇ


## Notes
Greek: εἴ γε καὶ 'if indeed'
There is no cause-consequence or evidence-conclusion relation between p and q here. Instead, p questions the accuracy of the suggestion that what they experienced or suffered was "for nothing" (ESV "in vain").


----------------

# Gal 3:18: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if inheritance comes by the law)
q: (it no longer comes by promise)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἐκ νόμου ἡ κληρονομία
* _q1_: οὐκέτι ἐξ ἐπαγγελίας


## Notes
The argument here rests on the assumption that inheritence can either come by the law or by the promise, but not by both. The situation stated in q, that the inheritence "no longer comes by promise" is negated in 3:18b: "but God gave it to Abraham by a promise." This shows that the statement "the inheritence comes by the law," that is assumed for the sake of argument in p, is false.


----------------

# Gal 3:21: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if a law had been given that could give life)
q: (then righteousness would indeed be by the law)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἐδόθη νόμος ὁ δυνάμενος ζῳοποιῆσαι
* _q1_: ὄντως ἐκ νόμου ἂν ἦν ἡ δικαιοσύνη


## Notes
Paul has already stated that righteousness does not come through the Jewish law (2:16) but by faith (3:11), so the premise in p is false: there is no law that can give life.


----------------

# Gal 3:29: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (and if you are Christ's)
q: (then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "now that you belong to Christ"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ὑμεῖς Χριστοῦ
* _q1_: ἄρα τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ σπέρμα ἐστέ κατ ἐπαγγελίαν κληρονόμοι


## Notes
Paul has just stated (3:28) "you are all one in Christ Jesus," so it is clear that "you are Christ's" is factual. The English connective then translates the Greek connective ἄρα which expresses a consequence or logical conclusion.


----------------

# Gal 4:7: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (and if a son)
q: (then [also] an heir through God)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ υἱός
* _q1_: καὶ κληρονόμος διὰ θεοῦ


## Notes
Paul has just stated "you are no longer a slave, but a son," so it is clear that p is factual. The word also has been added to the ESV translation here to express the sense of καὶ in Greek (see NIV, NRSV, NET).


----------------

# Gal 4:15: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if possible)
q: (you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me)


* ESV, NASB, RSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV: "had it been possible"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατὸν
* _q1_: τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν ἐξορύξαντες ἐδώκατέ μοι


## Notes
Like other "if possible" constructions, it signals the unlikeliness (or in this case, impossibility) of the proposition. However in this case, there is a clear q that depends on p for its fulfilment.


----------------

# Gal 5:2: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue / Warn


## English
p: (if you accept circumcision)
q: (Christ will be of no advantage to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν περιτέμνησθε
* _q1_: Χριστὸς ὑμᾶς οὐδὲν ὠφελήσει


## Notes
For a Gentile to become circumcised is a sign that they were choosing the law over Christ's sacrifice. The 'you' here is plural; probably some of Paul's audience had accepted circumcision and some were considering it.


----------------

# Gal 5:11: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
NASB:
p: (if I still preach circumcision)
q1: (why am I still persecuted?)
q2: (then teh stumbling block of the cross has been abolished)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐγὼ δέ ἀδελφοί εἰ περιτομὴν ἔτι κηρύσσω
* _q1_: τί ἔτι διώκομαι
* _q2_: ἄρα κατήργηται τὸ σκάνδαλον τοῦ σταυροῦ


## Notes
The question "Why am I still being persecuted?" indicates that Paul is being persecuted. Paul assumes that his audience knows that the people who are persecuting him are those who are teaching that circumcision is necessary (first mentioned in 1:7). P has scope over the next clause (introduced by ἄρα 'then') but most English translations (except NASB) translate this with "In that case" or something similar, as a way to refer back to "if I still preach circumcision".

# Gal 5:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (but if you bite and devour one another)
q: (watch out that you are consumed by one another)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ἀλλήλους δάκνετε καὶ κατεσθίετε
* _q1_: βλέπετε μὴ ὑπ ἀλλήλων ἀναλωθῆτε


## Notes
Paul is probably thinking of the divisions and fighting caused by the false teachers mentioned earlier.


----------------

# Gal 5:18: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (but if you are led by the Spirit)
q: (you are not under the law)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ πνεύματι ἄγεσθε
* _q1_: οὐκ ἐστὲ ὑπὸ νόμον


## Notes
Paul has instructed his readers to "walk by the Spirit" in v.16, so this is something that is likely but not certain (some people may not follow this instruction).


----------------

# Gal 5:25: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if we live by the Spirit)
q: (let us also keep in step with the Spirit)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ζῶμεν πνεύματι
* _q1_: πνεύματι καὶ στοιχῶμεν


## Notes
ζῶμεν ‘we live’ probably describes how the Spirit is the source of life for a believer, and so the conditional is factual. An alternative interpretation is that living by the Spirit is something that the believer chooses to do, just like “walk by the Spirit” in v.16, in which case p is very likely rather than factual.


----------------

# Gal 6:1: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if anyone is caught in transgression)
q: (you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NASB: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν καὶ προλημφθῇ ἄνθρωπος ἔν τινι παραπτώματι
* _q1_: ὑμεῖς οἱ πνευματικοὶ καταρτίζετε τὸν τοιοῦτον ἐν πνεύματι πραΰτητος


## Notes
Paul is not referring to a specific person. NASB "even if" treas the construction ἐὰν καὶ as a concessive conditional


----------------

# Gal 6:3: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral / Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn / Rebuke


## English
p: (for if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing)
q: (he deceives himself)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ δοκεῖ τις εἶναί τι μηδὲν ὤν
* _q1_: φρεναπατᾷ ἑαυτόν


## Notes
This may be a saying or proverb meant to warn all the Galatian believers not to become proud; in this case the probility is Neutral and the illocutionary force is Warn.. Alternatively, Paul may have specific people in mind. The Greek expression δοκεῖ τις εἶναί τι ‘thinks anyone to be something’ resembles the words that Paul used in Gal 2:6 to describe influential leaders of the church in Jerusalem, and probably specifically James (see Gal 2:12). This would make the probability Factual (as in 1Co 8:2) and the illocutionary force Rebuke.Possibly both of these interpretations could be valid.


----------------

# Gal 6:9: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage / Promise


## English



* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καιρῷ γὰρ ἰδίῳ θερίσομεν
* _p1_: μὴ ἐκλυόμενοι


## Notes
Implied conditional; the Greek has a participle verb μὴ ἐκλυόμενοι ‘not giving up’ rather than a conditional particle.


----------------

# Eph 4:20-21: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
NASB:
q: (you did not learn Christ in this way)
p: (if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus...)


* ESV: "assuming"
NASB: "if indeed"
NRSV: "For surely"
NIV: "when"
NLT: "Since" (see Note)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως ἐμάθετε τὸν Χριστόν
* _p1_: εἴ γε αὐτὸν ἠκούσατε καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐδιδάχθητε


## Notes
Greek: εἴ γε 'if indeed'
Most translations link the conditional in v.21 to the exclamation in v.20. NLT, however, links it to the (implied) command in v.22:
21 Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes from him, 22 throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception.
If εἴ γε is connected to v.20, then it either has a genuine conditional meaning (as in NASB) or a non-conditional meaning (as in ESV, NRSV, NIV - see note on Eph 3:2 below). If εἴ γε is connected to v.22, then it has a factual conditional meaning (as in NLT).


----------------

# Phil 1:22: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral / Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future / Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (if I am to live in the flesh)
q: (that means fruitful labour for me)
Or
p: (if to live means fruitful work for me)
q: (then I don’t know what to choose)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1or_: εἰ δὲ τὸ ζῆν ἐν σαρκί
* _p2or_: εἰ δὲ τὸ ζῆν ἐν σαρκί τοῦτό μοι καρπὸς ἔργου
* _q1or_: τοῦτό μοι καρπὸς ἔργου
* _q2or_: καὶ τί αἱρήσομαι οὐ γνωρίζω


## Notes
There are differences of opinion concerning the scope of the conditional here. In most English translations p = 22a and q = 22b (and 22c is not part of the conditional sentence): e.g. NRSV p [If I am to live in the flesh,] q [that means fruitful labor for me;] and I do not know which I prefer.
In most French translations p = 22a+b and q = 22c: But p [if to live means fruitful work for me] q [then I don’t know what to choose].
If p is 22a only, then the condition is hypothetical with a neutral probability (Paul might continue to live, but it is possible that he will die), but if p is 22a+b, then the condition is factual (Paul knows that by living he can do fruitful work).


----------------

# Phil 2:1-2: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
NASB:
p: (if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion)
q: (make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose)


* ESV, RSV, NIV, NASB: "if"
NLT: each clause in p is expressed as a rhetorical question


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις οὖν παράκλησις ἐν Χριστῷ εἴ τι παραμύθιον ἀγάπης εἴ τις κοινωνία πνεύματος εἴ τις σπλάγχνα καὶ οἰκτιρμοί
* _q1_: πληρώσατέ μου τὴν χαρὰν ἵνα τὸ αὐτὸ φρονῆτε τὴν αὐτὴν ἀγάπην ἔχοντες σύμψυχοι τὸ ἓν φρονοῦντες


## Notes
In Greek, εἴ repeated before each "any" in v.1 (see NASB and NIV).


----------------

# Phil 2:17: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
p: (even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith)
q: (I am glad and rejoice with you all)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ σπένδομαι ἐπὶ τῇ θυσίᾳ καὶ λειτουργίᾳ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν
* _q1_: χαίρω καὶ συγχαίρω πᾶσιν ὑμῖν


## Notes
Greek εἰ καὶ 'even if'; this is a "concessive conditional"; q is asserted as true, and p describes a situation which emphasizes q by virtue of its exceptional nature.


----------------

# Phil 3:4b: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh)
q: (I have more)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις δοκεῖ ἄλλος πεποιθέναι ἐν σαρκί
* _q1_: ἐγὼ μᾶλλον


## Notes
This is a speech act conditional - q is always true, but is only relevant if p is true. However, we know that p is actually true, because Paul has referred in v.2-3 to those who claimed that it was necessary to be circumcised - in other words, those who had "confidence in the flesh".


----------------

# Phil 3:15b: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if in anything you think otherwise)
q: (God will reveal that also to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ εἴ τι ἑτέρως φρονεῖτε
* _q1_: καὶ τοῦτο ὁ θεὸς ὑμῖν ἀποκαλύψει


## Notes
We have listed the probability as neutral becuase Paul is writing to "all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi", which includes those who are "mature" as well as those who "think differently".


----------------

# Phil 4:8b: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise)
q: (think about these things)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: expressed as a statment


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἀρετὴ καὶ εἴ τις ἔπαινος
* _q1_: ταῦτα λογίζεσθε


## Notes
The two clauses in p are either the last two items in a list of eight things that Paul commands his readers to think about (as in ESV, NASB and NRSV), or they provide a summary and evaluation of the previous six things (as in NIV and NLT).


----------------

# Col 1:22-23: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present / Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Promise


## English
q: v.22 (he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him)
p: v.23 (if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard)


* ESV, NASB: "if indeed"
NRSV: "provided that"
NIV: "if"
NLT: "But you must"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: νυνὶ δὲ ἀποκατηλλάγητε ἐν τῷ σώματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ διὰ τοῦ θανάτου παραστῆσαι ὑμᾶς ἁγίους καὶ ἀμώμους καὶ ἀνεγκλήτους κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ
* _p1_: εἴ γε ἐπιμένετε τῇ πίστει τεθεμελιωμένοι καὶ ἑδραῖοι καὶ μὴ μετακινούμενοι ἀπὸ τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου οὗ ἠκούσατε


## Notes
ει γε 'if indeed'
Elliot: "The particle γε performs its usual emphatic function, strengthening the word to which it is attached, and stresses the conditional nature of the concept."


----------------

# Col 2:5: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
p: (for though I am absent in body)
q: (yet I am with you in spirit)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "though"
NASB: "even though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ καὶ τῇ σαρκὶ ἄπειμι
* _q1_: ἀλλὰ τῷ πνεύματι σὺν ὑμῖν εἰμι


## Notes
εἰ καὶ 'even if'; This is a "concessive conditional," in which q is not dependent on the validity of p. In fact, there is a strong contrast between p and q here, indicated by the connective ἀλλὰ 'but' (ESV/NRSV 'yet', NASB 'nevertheless'). Paul highlights the contrast between "in body" and "in spirit" by fronting these before the verb phrases 'I am absent' and "I am with you" respectively.


----------------

# Col 2:20: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past / Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world)
q: (why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "since"
NLT: No conditional - statement


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἀπεθάνετε σὺν Χριστῷ ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων τοῦ κόσμου
* _q1_: τί ὡς ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ δογματίζεσθε


## Notes
It is true that we have died with Christ (2:11-12) and are not controlled by these "elementary principles of the world" (NASB; see also Gal 4:3-9), and this underlies NIV "since" and NLT "You have died with Christ..."
The Greek has an aorist verb in p: ἀπεθάνετε 'you(pl) died'; ESV, NRSV and NIV translate this as a simple past "you died" but NASB, NLT and NET translate this as a present perfect "you have died". Although this is something that happened in the past, it has ongoing, present time consequences.


----------------

# Col 3:1: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past / Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if then you have been raised with Christ)
q: (seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ οὖν συνηγέρθητε τῷ Χριστῷ
* _q1_: τὰ ἄνω ζητεῖτε οὗ ὁ Χριστός ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ θεοῦ καθήμενος


## Notes
It is also true that we have been raised with Christ (2:12-13), and this underlies NIV and NLT "since".
The Greek has an aorist verb in p: συνηγέρθητε 'you(pl) were raised with'. Unlike in 2:20, all the English versions mentioned translate this as a present perfect "you have been raised with" focusing on the present time consequences of this.


----------------

# Col 3:13: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
NIV:
q: (bear with each other and forgive one another)
q: (if any of you has a grievance against someone)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NASB: "whoever"
NLT: "anyone"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἀνεχόμενοι ἀλλήλων καὶ χαριζόμενοι ἑαυτοῖς
* _p1_: ἐάν τις πρός τινα ἔχῃ μομφήν


## Notes
ἐάν τις 'if anyone'
NIV follows the Greek in putting the whole of q before p. ESV, NRSV and NLT split up the two sections of q so that p ("if anyone has a complaint against another") precedes "forgive each other" (NRSV); this makes "Bear with one another" no longer part of q. However, it is likely that "Bear with one another and forgive each other" together constitute q (in the Greek they both come before p).


----------------

# Col 4:10c: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if he comes to you)
q: (welcome him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἔλθῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς
* _q1_: δέξασθε αὐτόν


----------------

# 1 Thess 3:8: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
q: (for now we live)
p: (if you are standing fast in the Lord)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "since"
NLT: untranslated/paraphrased


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ὅτι νῦν ζῶμεν
* _p1_: ἐὰν ὑμεῖς στήκετε ἐν κυρίῳ


## Notes
In Greek this is a mixed conditional (εαν + indicative).


----------------

# 1 Thess 4:14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
NLT:
p: (For since we believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again)
q: (we also believe that when Jesus returns, God will bring back with him the believers who have died)


* ESV, NRSV, NLT: "since"
NASB: "if"
NIV: p and q are statements joined by "and so"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ πιστεύομεν ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἀνέστη
* _q1_: οὕτως καὶ ὁ θεὸς τοὺς κοιμηθέντας διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἄξει σὺν αὐτῷ


## Notes
There is an understood "we believe" in q (that the NLT makes explicit). Paul is not saying that there is a cause-effect relationship between what we believe and what God will do, (i.e. if we believe that Jesus died and was raised, then God will bring with him those who have died). Rather, Paul is expressing that if we believe that Jesus died and was raised, then we also believe that God will bring with him those who have died.


----------------

# 2 Thess 2:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (for that day will not come)
p: (unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction...)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "unless"
NIV, NLT: "until"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἔλθῃ ἡ ἀποστασία πρῶτον καὶ ἀποκαλυφθῇ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τῆς ἀνομίας
* _q1_: ὅτι


## Notes
ἐὰν μὴ 'unless'
Q 'that day will not come' is not in the Greek, but is understood; most translations make this explicit. (Note: 'that day' refers to 'the day of the Lord' mentioned at the end of v.2.)
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): The day of the Lord will come only if the rebellion (against God) comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed...


----------------

# 2 Thess 3:10b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command / Warn


## English
p: (if anyone is not willing to work)
q: (let him not eat)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV: "anyone"
NIV: "the one who"
NLT: "those"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις οὐ θέλει ἐργάζεσθαι
* _q1_: μηδὲ ἐσθιέτω


----------------

# 2 Thess 3:14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (if anyone does not obey what we say in this letter)
q: (take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV, NLT: "those who"
NIV: "anyone who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δέ τις οὐχ ὑπακούει τῷ λόγῳ ἡμῶν διὰ τῆς ἐπιστολῆς
* _q1_: τοῦτον σημειοῦσθε μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι αὐτῷ ἵνα ἐντραπῇ


----------------

# 1 Tim 1:8: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (we know that the law is good)
p: (if one uses it lawfully)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καλὸς ὁ νόμος
* _p1_: ἐάν τις αὐτῷ νομίμως χρῆται


## Notes
The main point here is in q: the law is good; p qualifies this. There is a pun here in the use of νόμος 'law' and νομίμως 'lawfully'; some English translations use other expressions: 'legitimately' (NRSV), 'properly' (NIV), 'correctly' (NLT). 
If a conditional would be misleading or unnatural in translation (particularly if it is unnatural for q to precede p) this could be translated in other ways, for example using 'when' (as the NLT does), or expressions such as "so long as / provided that / assuming that it is used lawfully".


----------------

# 1 Tim 2:15: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
q: (she will be saved through childbearing)
p: (if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "if"
NRSV: "provided they..." 
NLT: "assuming they..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: σωθήσεται δὲ διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας
* _p1_: ἐὰν μείνωσιν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ καὶ ἁγιασμῷ μετὰ σωφροσύνης


## Notes
The time reference depends on the exegesis of this puzzling and controversial text. It seems to be an extension of the allusion to Genesis 3 from the previous verses (which explains the singular pronoun in 15a).The following universal statement brings God's salvation to that curse upon women in general (hence the switch to the plural pronoun in 15b).


----------------

# 1 Tim 3:1: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
p: (If anyone aspires to the office of overseer)
q: (he desires a noble task)


* ESV: "if anyone"
NASB: "if any man"
NRSV, NIV: "whoever"
NLT: "if someone"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἐπισκοπῆς ὀρέγεται
* _q1_: καλοῦ ἔργου ἐπιθυμεῖ


## Notes
Here and in v.5, Paul is making a general statement about people who aspire to be leaers in the church.


----------------

# 1 Tim 3:5: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (if someone does not know how to manage his own household) 
q: (how will he care for God’s church?)


* ESV, NRSV: "if someone"
NASB, NLT: "if a man"
NIV: "if anyone"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τις τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου προστῆναι οὐκ οἶδεν
* _q1_: πῶς ἐκκλησίας θεοῦ ἐπιμελήσεται


## Notes
See note on 1Ti 3:1.


----------------

# 1 Tim 3:15: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if I delay)
q: ([I write] so that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God)
Square brackets added to supply implied information


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NASB: "in case"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ βραδύνω
* _q1_: ἵνα εἰδῇς πῶς δεῖ ἐν οἴκῳ θεοῦ ἀναστρέφεσθαι ἥτις ἐστὶν ἐκκλησία θεοῦ ζῶντος στῦλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα τῆς ἀληθείας


## Notes
This is a speech act conditional, that is, q is true regardless of p (even if Paul is not delayed, he is still writing these instructions). However, if Paul delays, the fact that he is writing so that Timothy will know these things will be relevant, as in that case Paul won't be present to give this instruction in person. (P "if I delay" does not state the condition that will make q true but rather the situation that will make q relevant.) In Greek, q is introduced by ἵνα 'so that' and "I write" is implied.

# 1 Tim 5:4: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic

## English
p: (But if a widow has children or grandchildren)
q: (let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τις χήρα τέκνα ἢ ἔκγονα ἔχει
* _q1_: μανθανέτωσαν πρῶτον τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον εὐσεβεῖν καὶ ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι τοῖς προγόνοις


## Notes
Paul is making a general statement about the responsibilities of children and grandchildren of widows.


----------------

* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English

q: (he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV: "whoever"
NIV: "anyone who"
NLT: "those who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τις τῶν ἰδίων καὶ μάλιστα οἰκείων οὐ προνοεῖ
* _q1_: τὴν πίστιν ἤρνηται καὶ ἔστιν ἀπίστου χείρων


## Notes
This conditional buolds on v.4 and applies the same principal moe generally.

## English
q: (Let a widow be enrolled)
p1: (if she is not less than sixty years of age)
p2: (if she has been the wife of one husband)
p3: (if she has a reputation for good deeds)
p5-8 are either an elaboration of 'good deeds' or additional conditions


* ESV, NASB, NRSV:  "if"
NIV: "unless"
NLT relative clause ("who... must be")

## Notes
The syntax of vs.9-10 is confusing. It seems that there are eight requirements for a widow to be put on the list, but the first three are not expressed with a conditional marker ('if she is not' or 'unless she' has been supplied in most English translations). 
In the first condition in v.9, μὴ 'not' combines with ἐλάττων 'less than'. In some languages this verse may be more naturally/clearly rephrased as an affirmative statement: 'A widow is to be put on the list only if she is at least sixty years old / over sixty years old / sixty years old or more.'
The five conditions in v.10 expressed with ει can be understood in two ways. NRSV, ESV, NIV, and Mounce (2000) treat these as an elaboration of the third requisite "having a reputation for good deeds"; in this view, the five conditional clauses in v10 describe five examples of good deeds. NASB translates the five conditions in v.10 as continuing the list started in v.9.

# 1 Tim 5:16: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort / Command


## English
p: (If any believing woman has relatives who are widows)
q: (let her care for them)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις πιστὴ ἔχει χήρας
* _q1_: ἐπαρκείτω αὐταῖς


## Notes
Translator's Notes claims that Paul knew this to be the case, which would make this a factual condition.


----------------

# 1 Tim 5:19: First Class Condition




## English
ESV:
q: (Do not admit a charge against an elder)
p: (except on the evidence of two or three witnesses)
NIV:
q: (do not entertain an accusation against an elder)
p: (unless it is brought by two or three witnesses)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, "except"
NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἐκτὸς εἰ μὴ ἐπὶ δύο ἢ τριῶν μαρτύρων
* _p1_: κατὰ πρεσβυτέρου κατηγορίαν μὴ παραδέχου


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'if not' is modified by ἐκτὸς 'except'. This phrase is only used two other times and both those cases are conditional (1 Cor 14:5b; 15:2b). 
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): "Listen to/Consider an accusation against an elder only if two or three witnesses confirm it."


----------------

# 1 Tim 6:3-4: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness)
q: (he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "if anyone"
NRSV: "those who" 
NLT: "some people may..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖ καὶ μὴ προσέρχεται ὑγιαίνουσι λόγοις τοῖς τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ καὶ τῇ κατ εὐσέβειαν διδασκαλίᾳ
* _q1_: τετύφωται μηδὲν ἐπιστάμενος


## Notes
Translator's Notes claims that Paul knew that there were some people who were teaching false doctrines, making this a factual condition, and says that it could be translated "Whoever..." This reading underlies the use of "those who" in the NRSV. However, the use of a conditional allows Paul to talk about (and to) these people in an indirect, less confrontational way.


----------------

# Heb 2:2-3: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received just retribution)
q: (how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?)


* ESV, NIV: "since"
NASB, NRSV: "for if"
NLT: non-conditional statement


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ὁ δι ἀγγέλων λαληθεὶς λόγος ἐγένετο βέβαιος καὶ πᾶσα παράβασις καὶ παρακοὴ ἔλαβεν ἔνδικον μισθαποδοσίαν
* _q1_: πῶς ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα τηλικαύτης ἀμελήσαντες σωτηρίας


## Notes
An argument is made by using a rhetorical question (implied response of "we can't") which demands action.


----------------

# Heb 3:6: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise / Exhort


## English
q: (and we are his house)
p: (if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οἶκός ἐσμεν ἡμεῖς
* _p1_: τὴν παρρησίαν καὶ τὸ καύχημα τῆς ἐλπίδος κατάσχωμεν


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν[περ]  'if indeed'.
Q expresses a promise; p puts a limit on q, but more importantly it provides an implied exhortation to do p.


----------------

# Heb 3:7-10: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual / Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: today (if you hear his voice)
q: (do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness, where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε
* _q1_: μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ὡς ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ κατὰ τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ πειρασμοῦ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ οὗ ἐπείρασαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν ἐν δοκιμασίᾳ καὶ εἶδον τὰ ἔργα μου τεσσεράκοντα ἔτη


## Notes
The command lies in q. The probability of this conditional is tricky because when people harden their hearts, they become deaf to God speaking to them. So, despite God speaking, people may or may not hear him.


----------------

# Heb 3:14: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Exhort


## English
q: (we have come to share in Christ)
p: (if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: μέτοχοι γὰρ τοῦ Χριστοῦ γεγόναμεν
* _p1_: ἐάνπερ τὴν ἀρχὴν τῆς ὑποστάσεως μέχρι τέλους


## Notes
Greek: ἐάνπερ 'if indeed'; this connective is found only in Hebrews in the NT - here, in 6:3, and in 3:6 in certain manuscripts.


----------------

# Heb 3:15: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual / Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (today if you hear his voice)
q: (do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε
* _q1_: Μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ὡς ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ


## Notes
See note at 3:7.

NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε
* _q1_: μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν


## Notes
See note at 3:7.

# Heb 4:8: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (for if Joshua had given them rest)
q: (God would not have spoken of another day later on)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς κατέπαυσεν
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν περὶ ἄλλης ἐλάλει μετὰ ταῦτα ἡμέρας


## Notes
Elliot mentions that αν has been ommitted in some manuscripts, which is rare for non-factuals.


----------------

# Heb 6:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert


## English
q: (this we will do)
p: (if God permits)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "God permitting" 
NLT: "God willing"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καὶ τοῦτο ποιήσομεν
* _p1_: ἐάνπερ ἐπιτρέπῃ ὁ θεός


----------------

# Heb 6:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
q: (yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things—things that belong to salvation)
p: (though we speak this way)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "though"
NRSV, NIV, NLT: "even though"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Πεπείσμεθα δὲ περὶ ὑμῶν ἀγαπητοί τὰ κρείσσονα καὶ ἐχόμενα σωτηρίας
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ οὕτως λαλοῦμεν


## Notes
Greek: εἰ καὶ 'if indeed, even though'; this is a "concessive conditional".
The writer of Hebrews is quite harsh towards the audience in this section. He is softening his criticisms by saying [even though] we speak like this, we expect good things for you. 
The NASB keeps the inverted order q before p, while the ESV, NRSV, NIV, and NLT put p before q (the usual order).


----------------

# Heb 7:11: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law))
q: (what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ μὲν οὖν τελείωσις διὰ τῆς Λευιτικῆς ἱερωσύνης ἦν ὁ λαὸς γὰρ ἐπ αὐτῆς νενομοθέτηται
* _q1_: τίς ἔτι χρεία κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ ἕτερον ἀνίστασθαι ἱερέα καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρὼν λέγεσθαι


----------------

# Heb 7:15: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (this becomes even more evident)
p: (if/when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek...)


* ESV, NRSV: "when"
NASB, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Καὶ περισσότερον ἔτι κατάδηλόν ἐστιν
* _p1_: εἰ κατὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα Μελχισέδεκ ἀνίσταται ἱερεὺς ἕτερος


## Notes
"This" in q refers to v.14; p is a reference to Jesus (see v.16 and following).


----------------

# Heb 8:4: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if he were on earth)
q: (he would not be a priest at all)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὲν οὖν ἦν ἐπὶ γῆς
* _q1_: οὐδ ἂν ἦν ἱερεύς


----------------

# Heb 8:7: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual

q: (there would have been no occasion to look for a second)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ γὰρ ἡ πρώτη ἐκείνη ἦν ἄμεμπτος
* _q1_: οὐκ ἂν δευτέρας ἐζητεῖτο τόπος


----------------

# Heb 9:13-14: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of flesh)
q: (how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve a living God)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: p (v.13) is a statement, q (v.14) has "then"
NLT: non-conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ τὸ αἷμα τράγων καὶ ταύρων καὶ σποδὸς δαμάλεως ῥαντίζουσα τοὺς κεκοινωμένους ἁγιάζει πρὸς τὴν τῆς σαρκὸς καθαρότητα
* _q1_: πόσῳ μᾶλλον τὸ αἷμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ ὃς διὰ πνεύματος αἰωνίου ἑαυτὸν προσήνεγκεν ἄμωμον τῷ θεῷ καθαριεῖ τὴν συνείδησιν ἡμῶν


----------------

# Heb 10:38: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral

## English
p: (if he shrinks back)
q: (my soul has no pleasure in him)


* ESV, NASB: "if"
NRSV, NLT: "anyone who"
NIV:  "the one who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ ἐὰν ὑποστείληται
* _q1_: οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν αὐτῷ


----------------

# Heb 11:15: Second Class Condition


* *Probability:* Non-factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (if they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out)
q: (they would have had an opportunity to return)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὲν ἐκείνης μνημονεύουσιν ἀφ ἧς ἐξέβησαν
* _q1_: εἶχον ἂν καιρὸν ἀνακάμψαι


## Notes
P is proven to be non-factual by v.16.


----------------

# Heb 12:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if you are left without discipline, in which all have participated)
q: (then you are illegitimate children and not sons)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ χωρίς ἐστε παιδείας ἧς μέτοχοι γεγόνασι πάντες
* _q1_: ἄρα νόθοι καὶ οὐχ υἱοί ἐστε


----------------

# Heb 12:20: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if even a beast touches the mountain)
q: (it shall be stoned)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Κἂν θηρίον θίγῃ τοῦ ὄρους
* _q1_: λιθοβοληθήσεται


## Notes
Greek: κἂν
This is not a typical "concessive conditional." The meaning is not that if an animal even touches (as opposed to, say, stands on) the mountain, it will be stoned; rather, the meaning is that any living being, even an animal (as opposed to a human), will be stoned if it touches the mountain.


----------------

# Heb 12:25: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth)
q: (much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι οὐκ ἐξέφυγον ἐπὶ γῆς παραιτησάμενοι τὸν χρηματίζοντα
* _q1_: πολὺ μᾶλλον ἡμεῖς οἱ τὸν ἀπ οὐρανῶν ἀποστρεφόμενοι


----------------

# Heb 13:23: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Promise


## English
NASB (following Greek):
q: (with whom...)
p: (if he comes soon)
q: (...I shall see you...)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν τάχιον ἔρχηται
* _q1_: μεθ οὗ … ὄψομαι ὑμᾶς


## Notes
Timothy had been imprisioned but was now free (13:23a). We do not know the outcome of this conditional.
In the Greek, p occurs in the middle of q; most English translations put p before q (NRSV, NIV, NLT) or after q (ESV).


----------------

# James 1:5: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if any of you lacks wisdom)
q: (let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ δέ τις ὑμῶν λείπεται σοφίας
* _q1_: αἰτείτω παρὰ τοῦ διδόντος θεοῦ πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς καὶ μὴ ὀνειδίζοντος καὶ δοθήσεται αὐτῷ


----------------

# James 1:23: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer)
q: (he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in the mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV: "if any"
NIV: "anyone who"
NLT: "if you"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἀκροατὴς λόγου ἐστὶν καὶ οὐ ποιητής
* _q1_: οὗτος ἔοικεν ἀνδρὶ κατανοοῦντι τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ


----------------

# James 1:26: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
ESV:
p: (if anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart)
q: (this person's religion is worthless)
NIV:
p: (those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues)
q: (deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone"
NRSV: "if any"
NIV: "those who"
NLT: "if you"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις δοκεῖ θρησκὸς εἶναι μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ ἀλλὰ ἀπατῶν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: τούτου μάταιος ἡ θρησκεία


## Notes
In Greek, the verbs 'bridle' (or 'control') and 'deceive' are participle verb forms. ESV, NASB and NRSV include both of these participle verbs in p; NIV and NLT include 'deceive' in q (NLT: [If you claim to be religious but don’t control your tongue,]p [you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless.]q)
This idea of controlling the tongue is continued in 3:1-12.
The idea of a worthwhile religion (1:27) is carried on in 2:14-25.


----------------

# James 2:2-4: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (for if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into you assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, and [if] you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing ans say, "you sit here in a good place," while you say to the poor man, "you stand over there," or, "sit down at my feet")
q: (have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?)


* ESV, NRSV: "if" in v.2 and v.3
NASB: "if" once in v.2
NIV, NLT: "suppose" in v.2 and "if" in v.3


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν γὰρ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς συναγωγὴν ὑμῶν ἀνὴρ χρυσοδακτύλιος ἐν ἐσθῆτι λαμπρᾷ εἰσέλθῃ δὲ καὶ πτωχὸς ἐν ῥυπαρᾷ ἐσθῆτι ἐπιβλέψητε δὲ ἐπὶ τὸν φοροῦντα τὴν ἐσθῆτα τὴν λαμπρὰν καὶ εἴπητε Σὺ κάθου ὧδε καλῶς καὶ τῷ πτωχῷ εἴπητε Σὺ στῆθι ἢ κάθου ἐκεῖ ὑπὸ τὸ ὑποπόδιόν μου
* _q1_: οὐ διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ ἐγένεσθε κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν


## Notes
In Greek, ἐὰν 'if' occurs once at the start of v.2 and has scope over the whole of vv.2-3. NASB follows the Greek in this. ESV and NRSV repeat "if" at the start of v.3 (and in fact NRSV also repeats "if" before "a poor person" in v.2). NIV and NLT only have "if" at the start of v.3 but begin v.2 with "suppose".
"James’ goal is to help the reader realize that behaving along the lines of the scenario in the conditional frame is indeed showing partiality and not something else. This command is clearly laid out in v.1 and is practically illustrated in vv.2-4 to make sure that no one misses the point." (Runge 2010)


----------------

# James 2:8: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "you shall love your neighbour as yourself,")
q: (you are doing well)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ μέντοι νόμον τελεῖτε βασιλικὸν κατὰ τὴν γραφήν Ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν
* _q1_: καλῶς ποιεῖτε


## Notes
NRSV and NLT invert the order of p and q.


----------------

# James 2:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke


## English
p: (but if you show partiality)
q: (you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ προσωπολημπτεῖτε
* _q1_: ἁμαρτίαν ἐργάζεσθε ἐλεγχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου ὡς παραβάται


## Notes
This contrasts with v.8.


----------------

# James 2:11b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Unlikely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Argue


## English
p: (if you do not commit adultery but do murder)
q: (you have become a transgressor of the law)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ οὐ μοιχεύεις φονεύεις δέ
* _q1_: γέγονας παραβάτης νόμου


## Notes
This illustrates the point of v.10 (whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it). It can be understood as 'Even if you do not commit adultery, but if you commit murder, you have still broken the law.'


----------------

# James 2:14: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Argue


## English
q: (what good is it)
p: (if someone says he has faith but does not have works?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Τί ὄφελος
* _p1_: ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ


----------------

# James 2:15-16: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Argue


## English
p: (if a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, "go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things needed for the body)
q: (what good is it?)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "suppose" (v.15), "if" (v.16)
NLT: "suppose"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἀδελφὴ γυμνοὶ ὑπάρχωσιν καὶ λειπόμενοι τῆς ἐφημέρου τροφῆς εἴπῃ δέ τις αὐτοῖς ἐξ ὑμῶν Ὑπάγετε ἐν εἰρήνῃ θερμαίνεσθε καὶ χορτάζεσθε μὴ δῶτε δὲ αὐτοῖς τὰ ἐπιτήδεια τοῦ σώματος
* _q1_: τί ὄφελος


## Notes
The structure of this onditional is similar to 2:2-4.


----------------

# James 2:17: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
q: (faith by itself)
p: (if it does not have works)
q: (is dead)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if...no(t)"
NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἔχῃ ἔργα
* _q1_: οὕτως καὶ ἡ πίστις … νεκρά ἐστιν καθ ἑαυτήν


## Notes
It may not be natural to keep p embedded within q; it may be necessary to restructure as: 'If faith is not accompanied by works, it is dead.' Or: 'Faith alone without works is dead.'

p: (if you judge the law)
q: (you are not a doer of the law, but a judge)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "when"
NLT: non-conditional statement (but "if" is used in the previous clause)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ νόμον κρίνεις
* _q1_: οὐκ εἶ ποιητὴς νόμου ἀλλὰ κριτής


## Notes
Judging the law' in the verse is referring back to the first part of the verse where James says, "the one who speaks against his brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law."

q: (let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἐν ὑμῖν πλανηθῇ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀληθείας καὶ ἐπιστρέψῃ τις αὐτόν
* _q1_: γινωσκέτω ὅτι ὁ ἐπιστρέψας ἁμαρτωλὸν ἐκ πλάνης ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ σώσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ θανάτου καὶ καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν


## Notes
The focus is on the "someone brings him back" section, not the "if anyone wanders"

# 1Pe 1:6: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past

## English
p: (though now for a little while, if necessary)
q: (you have been grieved by various trials)


* ESV, NASB: "if necessary"
NRSV: "even if" (applied to q)
NIV, NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὀλίγον ἄρτι εἰ δέον
* _q1_: λυπηθέντες ἐν ποικίλοις πειρασμοῖς


## Notes
The condition acknowledges the trials the audience have suffered while also confirming that they were necessary. The idea of the trials being necessary is expressed in various ways in English: "you have had to suffer various trials" (NRSV), "you may have had to suffer..." (NIV), "you must endure many trials" (NLT).

p: (and if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds)
q: (conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile...)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: "since"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ πατέρα ἐπικαλεῖσθε τὸν ἀπροσωπολήμπτως κρίνοντα κατὰ τὸ ἑκάστου ἔργον
* _q1_: ἐν φόβῳ τὸν τῆς παροικίας ὑμῶν χρόνον ἀναστράφητε


## Notes
The fact that our heavenly Father "judges each person's work impartially" (that is, "He will judge or reward you according to what you do" - NLT) is the reason why we should live in reverent fear; p is therefore the reason for q, and in some languages a connective such as 'because' may be more natural than a conditional.


----------------

# 1Pe 2:2-3: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual

q: (like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation...)
p: (if you have tasted that the Lord is good)


* ESV, NRSV: "if indeed"
NASB: "if"
NIV, NLT: "now that"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ὡς ἀρτιγέννητα βρέφη τὸ λογικὸν ἄδολον γάλα ἐπιποθήσατε ἵνα ἐν αὐτῷ αὐξηθῆτε εἰς σωτηρίαν
* _p1_: εἰ ἐγεύσασθε ὅτι χρηστὸς ὁ κύριος


## Notes
There are various interpretations of where q starts. It could be argued that 2:1 is also a part of q, as in NASB: "putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babes..." At the other extreme, NLT includes only the last clause in q: [Cry out for this nourishment,]q [now that you have had a taste of the Lord's kindness.]p Most English translations, however, treat the whole of v.2 as q.

## English
NRSV:
q: (for it is a credit to you)
p: (if, being aware of God, you endure pain while suffering unjustly)

NIV::
q: (it is commendable)
p: (if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God)


* ESV, NLT: "when"
NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τοῦτο γὰρ χάρις
* _p1_: εἰ διὰ συνείδησιν θεοῦ ὑποφέρει τις λύπας πάσχων ἀδίκως


## Notes
Note that "being aware of God" (ESV "mindful of God") is parenthetical and is not he main clause in p. That is, the meaning is NOT "it is commendable, if a person is aware of God" NOR "if a person is aware of God, they will endure pain while suffering unjustly." Rather, the meaning IS "it is commendable if a person endures pain while suffering unjustly, because they are aware of God." This may need to be rephrased to keep the relations clear in some languages, e.g. "if a person endures pain while suffering unjustly, because they are aware of God, that is commendable."

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ποῖον γὰρ κλέος
* _p1_: εἰ ἁμαρτάνοντες καὶ κολαφιζόμενοι ὑπομενεῖτε


## Notes
This conditional forms a contrastive pair with v.20b. Together these have a chiastic structure: q1, p1, p2, q2. NRSV changes the order to p1, q1, p2, q2, which might be more natural in some languages: [If you endure when you are beaten for doing wrong,]p1 [what credit is that?]q1 [But if you endure when you do right and suffer for it,]p2 [you have God’s approval.]q2

The entire conditional is a rhetorical question witth the assumed response being 'no one.'

* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ πάσχοιτε διὰ δικαιοσύνην
* _q1_: μακάριοι


## Notes
Greek: εἰ καὶ 'even if'; this is a "concessive conditional." 
In Greek "you" here is plural. There is no verb in q so English translations have supplied "you are" or "you will be" before "blessed".
Boyer (1982b: 171) suggests that this could be an example of a class 4 conditional as the verb in p is in the optative mood.

q: (...than for doing evil)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ θέλοι τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ
* _q1_: κρεῖττον γὰρ ἀγαθοποιοῦντας … πάσχειν ἢ κακοποιοῦντας


## Notes
P is a parenthetical clause in the middle of q; it can be made explicit as "if it is God's will that you should suffer" (see also NRSV: "For it is better to suffer for doing good, if suffering should be God’s will, than to suffer for doing evil.") In some languages it may be more natural to place p at the beginning of the sentence: "if it is God's will that you should suffer, then it is better to suffer for doing good than to suffer for doing evil."
Boyer (1982b: 171) suggests that this could be an example of a class 4 conditional as the verb in p is in the optative mood.

* _p1_: εἰ δὲ ὡς Χριστιανός
* _q1_: μὴ αἰσχυνέσθω δοξαζέτω δὲ τὸν θεὸν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ


## Notes
In Greek there is no verb in p; the verb 'suffer' from v.15 is understood, so English translations have supplied "anyone suffers", "any of you suffers", or "you suffer".

p: (for if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked (for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard)
q: (then the Lod knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: no conditional


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ γὰρ ὁ θεὸς ἀγγέλων ἁμαρτησάντων οὐκ ἐφείσατο ἀλλὰ σειραῖς ζόφου ταρταρώσας παρέδωκεν εἰς κρίσιν τηρουμένους καὶ ἀρχαίου κόσμου οὐκ ἐφείσατο ἀλλὰ ὄγδοον Νῶε δικαιοσύνης κήρυκα ἐφύλαξεν κατακλυσμὸν κόσμῳ ἀσεβῶν ἐπάξας καὶ πόλεις Σοδόμων καὶ Γομόρρας τεφρώσας καταστροφῇ κατέκρινεν ὑπόδειγμα μελλόντων ἀσεβέσιν τεθεικώς καὶ δίκαιον Λὼτ καταπονούμενον ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν ἀθέσμων ἐν ἀσελγείᾳ ἀναστροφῆς ἐρρύσατο βλέμματι γὰρ καὶ ἀκοῇ ὁ δίκαιος ἐγκατοικῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας ψυχὴν δικαίαν ἀνόμοις ἔργοις ἐβασάνιζεν
* _q1_: οἶδεν κύριος εὐσεβεῖς ἐκ πειρασμοῦ ῥύεσθαι ἀδίκους δὲ εἰς ἡμέραν κρίσεως κολαζομένους τηρεῖν


## Notes
Most English translations supply 'if' before each new example in verses 4, 5, 6 and 7, but the Greek only has ει once at the beginning of v.4.
Although this long sentence reminds the readers of events where God demonstrated his wrath and judgement, it is intended to reassure the audience that God will protect the righteous.

This is classified as factual because v.19 states, "they themslves are slaves of corruption."

(NLT partially inverts)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν εἴπωμεν ὅτι κοινωνίαν ἔχομεν μετ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῷ σκότει περιπατῶμεν
* _q1_: ψευδόμεθα καὶ οὐ ποιοῦμεν τὴν ἀλήθειαν


## Notes
The conditionals in ch.1 form contrastive pairs: 1:6 "if we... walk in darkness" vs. 1.7 "if we walk in light", 1:8/10 "if we say we have no sin/have not sinned" vs. 1:9 "if we confess our sins". As far as possible, these should be translated using the same conditional construction. Runge (2010) comments on these verses:
"The opening chapter of 1 John has a series of conditional frames that allow the writer to quickly switch from one state of affairs to another. Each clause, by changing the condition for the main clause that follows, provides a new perspective on what it means to have fellowship with Jesus. There is noticeable contrast between the clauses based on the semantics of the content, but it is heightened through the use of frames to juxtapose opposite conditions with their correlating consequences. ... The parallel syntax and wording of vv. 6, 8, and 10 help to insure that the reader connects these verses."

* _q1_: ἑαυτοὺς πλανῶμεν καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἡμῖν


## Notes
See note on 1:6. Runge (2010) writes:
"Verse 8 establishes that there is no room for denying that we have sin. This raises the question of how we should respond to sin in light of the fact that it is universal. Verse 9 provides the answer using another conditional frame."

Kruse (2000) claims that this verse is essentially a restatement of 1:8, although there is a crucially different nuance here.

* _p1_: καὶ ἐάν τις ἁμάρτῃ
* _q1_: παράκλητον ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν δίκαιον


## Notes
Greek καὶ ἐάν sometimes expresses a "concessive conditional", but no major English translations use the concessive construction "even if"; καὶ here is simply connecting 1a and 1b, and in English "but" is an appropriate translation.

## English
NIV:
q: (We know that we have come to know him) 
p: (if we keep his commands)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Καὶ ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν ὅτι ἐγνώκαμεν αὐτόν
* _p1_: ἐὰν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ τηρῶμεν


## Notes
Smalley (1984) and Haas et al. (1994) claim that the introductory phrase ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν "by this we know" is commonly used in 1 John to introduce a conclusion; this is how the NIV and the NLT render the verse. While Haas et al. (1994) argue that ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν marks p as being factual, Marshall (1978a) disagrees and argues that John stated it as an undetermined (i.e. neutral) conditional in order to invite his readers to reflect on whether they are fulfilling that condition. This is the interpretation we have followed.
While the overall function of this conditional is to encourage, Haas et al. (1994) and Persson (2000) note that there is also an implied exhortation in p.
(NIV also has a conditional in 2:5, but most other English versions have 'whoever'. The Greek in v.5 is ὃς ἂν 'whoever'.)

# 1Jn 2:15b: Third Class Condition

## English
p: (If anyone loves the world,) 
q: (the love of the Father is not in him.)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "if anyone"
NRSV: "those who"
NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἀγαπᾷ τὸν κόσμον
* _q1_: οὐκ ἔστιν ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ πατρὸς ἐν αὐτῷ


## Notes
This conditional provides a reason for the command in 2:15a "Do not love the world or the things in the world.".
John is not saying that loving the world causes a person not to love the Father or express the Father's love, rather he is saying that loving the world shows (is evidence) that a person does not have the love of the Father. As Stott (1988) notes, it is another "test" or "sign" of whether a person is following Christ.

p: (if they had been of us,) 
q: (they would have continued with us)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "otherwise"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ ἐξ ἡμῶν ἦσαν
* _q1_: μεμενήκεισαν ἂν μεθ ἡμῶν


## Notes
The context of 2:19a,c makes it clear that p is false.

# 1Jn 2:24b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
p: (If what you heard from the beginning abides in you,) 
q: (then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father.)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἐν ὑμῖν μείνῃ ὃ ἀπ ἀρχῆς ἠκούσατε
* _q1_: καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐν τῷ υἱῷ καὶ ἐν τῷ πατρὶ μενεῖτε


## Notes
The probability of this conditional is Very Likely because 2:20 and 2:27 both indicate that John's audience are following what they have been taught. 
Smalley (1984) and Haas et al. (1994) note that the fronted pronoun ὑμεῖς 'you(pl)' that starts 2:24a indicates that the audience's obedience isbeing contrasted with the liars mentioned in v.22.


----------------

# 1Jn 2:29: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (If you know that he is righteous,) 
q: (you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν εἰδῆτε ὅτι δίκαιός ἐστιν
* _q1_: γινώσκετε ὅτι πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν τὴν δικαιοσύνην ἐξ αὐτοῦ γεγέννηται


## Notes
In 2:1 John has stated that Jesus Christ is righteous, and so this conditional is factual (which is why NLT uses "since").


----------------

# 1Jn 3:13: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Very Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Present
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
NASB
q: (Do not be surprised, brethren,) 
p: (if the world hates you)


* ESV, NRSV: "that"
NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: μὴ θαυμάζετε ἀδελφοί
* _p1_: εἰ μισεῖ ὑμᾶς ὁ κόσμος


## Notes
Smalley (1984) and Haas et al. (1994) argue that this is a factual conditional, and this interpretation also underlies the use of "that" rather than "if" in the ESV and NRSV translations.


----------------

# 1 Jn 3:20: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
NIV:
p: (If our hearts condemn us) 
q: (we know that God is greater than our hearts)
or
ESV:
p: (whenever our heart condemns us)
q: (God is greater than our heart)
or
NRSV:
q: (we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him)
p: (whenever our hearts condemn us)


* ESV, NRSV: "whenever"
NASB: "in whatever"
NIV: "if"
NLT: "even if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν καταγινώσκῃ ἡμῶν ἡ καρδία
* _q1_: ὅτι μείζων ἐστὶν ὁ θεὸς τῆς καρδίας ἡμῶν


## Notes
Stott (1988:148) describes verses 19-20 well when he states that "its general sense is clear, but it is grammatically confused, and from the earliest days commentators have had difficulty in interpreting it." There are two issues: 1) does p begin ὅτι ἐὰν "that if" or ὅ τι ἐάν "whenever"? 2) Does p modify the following clause (giving the order p, q) or does it modify v.19 (giving the order q, p)? These options are reflected in the NIV, ESV and NRSV translations.
1) The UBS text has ὅτι ἐὰν "that if" (this interpretation is also favoured by Kruse (\2000), but many scholars think that the text should read ὅ τι ἐάν meaning "whenever" (Smalley 1984; Marshall 1978a; Stott 1988; Haas et al. 1994; Jobes 2014). Both of these interpretations are possible. Many languages have a construction that can mean both "if" and "when" depending on the context, and such a construction would be appropriate here. 
2) Stott (1988) and Marshall (1978) state that this verse is intended to comfort a believer who will inevitably have feelings of guilt, and so p modifies the following clause (giving the order p, q). This seems the most liely interpretation to us as well.
Taken together, we feel that NIV and ESV provides the best models.


----------------

# 1Jn 3:21: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
p: (if our heart does not condemn us)
q: (we have confidence before God)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἡ καρδία μὴ καταγινώσκῃ ἡμῶν
* _q1_: παρρησίαν ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν θεόν


## Notes
This conditional presents the alternative to v.20.


----------------

# 1Jn 4:11: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Past
* *Illocutionary Force:* Exhort


## English
p: (if God so loved us)
q: (we also ought to love one another)


* ESV, NASB: "if"
NRSV, NIV, NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ οὕτως ὁ θεὸς ἠγάπησεν ἡμᾶς
* _q1_: καὶ ἡμεῖς ὀφείλομεν ἀλλήλους ἀγαπᾶν


## Notes
P refers back to the past events described in 4:9-10 and so this is a factual conditional; many English translations express this with "since".


----------------

# 1Jn 4:12: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Likely
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Encourage


## English
p: (if we love one another)
q: (God abides in us and his love is perfected in us)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἀγαπῶμεν ἀλλήλους
* _q1_: ὁ θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν μένει καὶ ἡ ἀγάπη αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν τετελειωμένη ἐστιν


## Notes
This conditional follows from v.11 and assumes that the audience do in fact love one another. Q expresses both a promise and a motivation for loving one another, and so the whole conditional sentence strengthens the exhortation in v.11.


----------------

# 1Jn 4:20: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Rebuke / Argue


## English
p: (If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother)
q: (he is a liar)


* ESV, "if anyone"
NASB, NLT: "if someone"
NRSV: "those who"
NIV: "whoever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις εἴπῃ ὅτι Ἀγαπῶ τὸν θεόν καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ μισῇ
* _q1_: ψεύστης ἐστίν


## Notes
Greek: ἐάν τις 'if anyone'.


----------------

# 1Jn 5:9: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Argue


## English
p: (If we receive the testimony of men)
q: (the testimony of God is greater)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV: rephrased as statement
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ τὴν μαρτυρίαν τῶν ἀνθρώπων λαμβάνομεν
* _q1_: ἡ μαρτυρία τοῦ θεοῦ μείζων ἐστίν


## Notes
Stott (1988) states that the background for this verse is the Jewish practice of accepting the testimony of two or three witnesses, which seems likely given the previous reference to three witnesses. Others take it to refer to the general human practice of trusting the word of other people (Marshall 1978a). Either way, p is assumed to be true, and the implication is that we should also accept the testimony of God.


----------------

# 1Jn 5:14b: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Promise


## English
p: (if we ask anything according to his will)
q: (he hears us.)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "whenever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τι αἰτώμεθα κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ
* _q1_: ἀκούει ἡμῶν


## Notes
This conditional is very similar to John 14:14. The Greek word τι 'anything' indicates that this is a promise that is always true; this underlies the NLT and NET translation "whenever we ask for anything". The phrase ἐάν τι can also mean 'whatever'.


----------------

# 1Jn 5:15a: (Unspecified) Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Encourage


## English
p: (if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask)
q: (we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
NLT: "since"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἀκούει ἡμῶν ὃ ἐὰν αἰτώμεθα
* _q1_: οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἔχομεν τὰ αἰτήματα ἃ ᾐτήκαμεν ἀπ αὐτοῦ


## Notes
See note on v.14b. This verse is still describing the consequences of 5:13. Because v.14 promises that God wil hear us we know this, and so p is true.
The Greek of this construction is slightly unusual because it employs ἐὰν + an indicative verb, which combines the class 3 connective with the class 1 verb form. Elliott (1981:84, 86) describes this as an irregular class 1; Boyer mentions this verse in footnotes (1982b:164; 1983:175) but never clearly states what class he considers it to be.
(P also contains the embedded phrase ὃ ἐὰν αἰτώμεθα "whatever we ask" which is listed as a non-conditional occurrence of ἐὰν below.)


----------------

# 1Jn 5:16: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Gnomic
* *Illocutionary Force:* Assert / Exhort


## English
p: (If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death)
q: (he shall ask, and God will give him life—to those who commit sins that do not lead to death)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἴδῃ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἁμαρτάνοντα ἁμαρτίαν μὴ πρὸς θάνατον
* _q1_: αἰτήσει καὶ δώσει αὐτῷ ζωήν τοῖς ἁμαρτάνουσιν μὴ πρὸς θάνατον


## Notes
The Greek ἐάν τις 'if anyone' is followed by an the verb αἰτήσει which can be interpreted either as an assertion 'he will ask' (ESV, NASB) or as an imperative 'let him ask' or 'he should ask' (NET). Because this strongly implies a command, some translations (NRSV, NIV, NLT) change 'anyone' to 'you' (NRSV: "If you see your brother or sister...")


----------------

# 2Jn 1:10: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Command


## English
p: (If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching,)
q: (do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"
NRSV: "anyone who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ταύτην τὴν διδαχὴν οὐ φέρει
* _q1_: μὴ λαμβάνετε αὐτὸν εἰς οἰκίαν καὶ χαίρειν αὐτῷ μὴ λέγετε


## Notes
Greek: εἴ τις 'if anyone'.
Smalley (1984) points out that the NT as a whole and the apostle John in particular commends hospitality as a virtue and a necessary part of the Christian life. But John issues this warning in the circumstance of anticipating heretical apologists welcomed into the houses and churches of the faithful. For these reasons, this command seems to be bound to this particular context and is not a gnomic assertion.


----------------

# 3Jn 1:10: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Factual
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if I come,) 
q: (I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense against us)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "if"
NIV, NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν ἔλθω
* _q1_: ὑπομνήσω αὐτοῦ τὰ ἔργα ἃ ποιεῖ λόγοις πονηροῖς φλυαρῶν ἡμᾶς


## Notes
Smalley (1984), Haas et al. (1994), Persson (2000), and Marshall (1978a) argue that given the intent to visit expressed in v14, this conditional is presented as a confident prediction with only the time yet to be decided.


----------------

# Rev 2:5b: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if not)
q: (I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if...not"
NASB: "or else"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή
* _q1_: κινήσω τὴν λυχνίαν σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῆς


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή 'if not', 'otherwise' with an elided (understood) verb. 
This phrase presents the alternative to "repent, and do the works that you did at first" in the previous clause; NIV and NLT make this explicit: "If you do not repent."
Both condtionals in v.5 share the same q. The p of v.5b comes before q, and the p of v.5c comes after q.


----------------

# Rev 2:5c: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
q: (I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place)
p: (unless you repent)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "unless"
NIV, NLT: untranslated (in 2.5b)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἔρχομαί σοι καὶ κινήσω τὴν λυχνίαν σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῆς
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ μετανοήσῃς


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'unless'
See note on 2.5b. Because NIV and NLT have "If you do not repent" in 2.5b, they do not repeat this here.


----------------

# Rev 2:16: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
p: (if not)
q: (I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth)


* ESV, NRSV: "if not"
NASB: "or else"
NIV: "otherwise"
NLT: "or"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δὲ μή
* _q1_: ἔρχομαί σοι ταχύ καὶ πολεμήσω μετ αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ τοῦ στόματός μου


## Notes
Greek: εἰ δὲ μή 'if not', 'otherwise' with an elided (understood) verb. 
This phrase presents the alternative to 'repent' in the previous clause (similar to v.5b).


----------------

# Rev 2:22: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
q: those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation)
p: (unless they repent of her works)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "unless"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἰδοὺ βάλλω αὐτὴν εἰς κλίνην καὶ τοὺς μοιχεύοντας μετ αὐτῆς εἰς θλῖψιν μεγάλην
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ μετανοήσωσιν ἐκ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῆς


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'unless' (i.e. 'if not')
V.21 mentions 'repent' twice, so "unless they repent of her deeds" is meant to reinforce this.


----------------

# Rev 3:3: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral
* *Time Orientation:* Future
* *Illocutionary Force:* Warn


## English
NASB:
p: (if you do not wake up) [ESV: if you will not wake up]
q: (I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come to you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if... not"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὖν μὴ γρηγορήσῃς
* _q1_: ἥξω ὡς κλέπτης


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'unless' (i.e. 'if not')


----------------

# Rev 3:20: Third Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐάν τις ἀκούσῃ τῆς φωνῆς μου καὶ ἀνοίξῃ τὴν θύραν
* _q1_: καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ δειπνήσω μετ αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτὸς μετ ἐμοῦ


## Notes
There is a promise in q, but also an implied exhortation to "open the door" in p.


----------------

# Rev 11:5a: First Class Condition


* *Probability:* Neutral

## English
NASB:

## Notes
Greek: ει + subjunctive

NRSV, NLT: "anyone (who)" 
NIV: "whoever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τις ἔχει οὖς
* _q1_: ἀκουσάτω


## Notes
Similar to the commandment given to each of the seven churches (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22): ὁ ἔχων οὖς  'the one having an ear' (ESV: "he who has an ear").

NLT: "anyone"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τις ἐν μαχαίρῃ ἀποκτανθῆναι
* _q1_: αὐτὸν ἐν μαχαίρῃ ἀποκτανθῆναι


## Notes
The NASB and NRSV translate p as an active statement ("if anyone kills") rather than a passive one ("if anyone is to be killled"), following Genesis 9:6.


----------------

NLT: "without"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: μή τις δύνηται ἀγοράσαι ἢ πωλῆσαι
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὁ ἔχων τὸ χάραγμα


## Notes

* _q1_: καὶ αὐτὸς πίεται ἐκ τοῦ οἴνου τοῦ θυμοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ κεκερασμένου ἀκράτου ἐν τῷ ποτηρίῳ τῆς ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ βασανισθήσεται ἐν πυρὶ καὶ θείῳ ἐνώπιον ἀγγέλων ἁγίων καὶ ἐνώπιον τοῦ ἀρνίου

* _q1_: ἐπιθήσει ὁ θεὸς ἐπ αὐτὸν τὰς πληγὰς τὰς γεγραμμένας ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ

The conditionals in 22:18-19 together warn of the consequences of changing anything that John has written in this book.
