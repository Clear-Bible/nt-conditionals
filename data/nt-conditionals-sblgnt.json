Many English translations reflect this tense change and use \"had not cut short\". Because \"those days\" are still in the future, this should be understood as \"had not decided to cut short.\" This gives a non-factual interpretation: \"If the Lord had not decided to cut short those days (but he did), no one would survive.\" This is confirmed because the parallel passage in Mat 24:22 states directly afterward that \"those days will be cut short.\" Although the double negative makes it confusing this is a non-factual conditional. \nIf this is paraphrased to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except', this should be expressed as a future event: \"Only if the Lord shortens [i.e. will shorten] those days will any person (lit: flesh) be saved.\"",

The disciples do not really believe that Jesus expects them to go and buy food (in fact, the parallel passage in Mark notes how beyond their means even a low estimate of the cost would be). \nThe NLT offers an alternative to using 'unless': “But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered. “Or are you expecting us to go and buy enough food for this whole crowd?” (This also easily fits with Nolland's assessment that this statement from the disciples \"could easily be read as sarcasm\".)

In the parallel passage in Matthew 17:20, Jesus describes the disciples as having \"so little faith. However, the time reference appears to be gnomic rather than restricted to the moment of speech, suggesting that this statement is applicable to all who have faith rather than just to the original disciples. However, the context here is different, and Jesus seems to be teaching them that the dsiciples do not require an increase of faith, but rather that whatever faith they have is enough to produce great results.",

To avoid multiple negatives, q can be expressed as affirmative (as in the ESV, NRSN, NIV, and NLT). If necessary, the answer to the question can be supplied: \"Of course not.\"\nNote also that the Greek literally says that the law judges and hears.

Q seems to contain three clauses, though it is possible to read v. 32 as a separate elaboration of the result of being a disciple (see NIV). If v.32 is included in the q, interestingly, that puts q in v.31 in a different semantic relation than q in v.32. The first is an evidence-inference relationship (abiding in my word shows that you are my disciples), while the second and third clauses in v. 32 would be in a cause-effect relation to p (abiding in my word will cause you to know the truth).",

Most translations treat q as a statement \"you would be doing\" (ESV, NRSV, NET) or \"you would do\" (NIV) but NASB treats q as a command \"do the deeds of Abraham.\" Jesus' point is that though his audience may indeed be Abraham's biological descendents, they were not in fact his spiritual descendents, based on their actions.",

However, the UBS Greek has a perfect verb in p and a future verb in q (with the variants listed in the footnotes); the interpretation in the NIV is based on this. The alternative class 2 interpreation seems to imply that the disciples haven't really known Jesus, but now do. There is merit in both interpretations, and Jesus' point either way is that he and the Father are one; knowledge of him is the same thing as knowledge of the Father, so the disciples do indeed know the Father.",

In the same way, you can only bear fruit if you remain in me.\" (Translators should also consider the words to use for 'branch' and 'vine', and whether \"remain in me\" is a metaphor that communicates clearly and naturally.)\nNLT uses an affirmative conditional with a verb that means the opposite of 'remain': \"a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed [cut off] from the vine.\"\nDigo translation: \"Hold tightly* to me, and I will hold tightly to you. For a branch cannot bear fruit alone, until it holds tightly to the vine itself. So it is with you also, you cannot bear fruits until you hold tightly to me.\" (* 'Hold tightly' is a translation of \"gbwirana\", the reciprocal form of the verb 'hold'; it can also mean 'be attached to'.)",

    "notes": "One interpretation of this conditional is that it refers to a different group of people than in v.20b (or to a sub-group of people within the general group referred to as “the world”). Carson (1991) explains: ‘If they persecuted me (and many of them did), they will persecute you also; if they obeyed my teaching (and some of them did), they will obey yours also.’ If this interpretation is followed, one possible way to translate v.20b-c is: \"Those who persecuted me will also persecute you(pl), and/but those who kept my word will also keep yours(pl).\"\nAn alternative interpretation, noted by Carson (1991) and Beasley-Murray (1999), treats the conditional in v.20c as non-factual and therefore complementary to rather than in contrast with v.20b. This interpretation accords with the overall theme of Jhn 15:18-25, which is that the people of the world hate Jesus and will therefore also hate the disciples, and is followed in the NLT: \"Since they persecuted me, naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would listen to you.\"",

In Greek, p1 has κἂν and p2 has καὶ ἐὰν both of which can be understood either as 'even if or 'and if', but no English translation translates these as concessives (except KJV & NKJV which use \"though\"). Most English translations follow the Greek and use \"if\" twice, but NIV and NLT only use \"if\" once. As with 13:2, these positive statements are followed by one negative statement \"but love I do not have\", which overrides the positive statements; in Greek there is emphasis on \"love\" (which is fronted).",

    "notes": "The syntax of vs.9-10 is confusing. It seems that there are eight requirements for a widow to be put on the list, but the first three are not expressed with a conditional marker ('if she is not' or 'unless she' has been supplied in most English translations). \nIn the first condition in v.9, μὴ 'not' combines with ἐλάττων 'less than'. In some languages this verse may be more naturally/clearly rephrased as an affirmative statement: 'A widow is to be put on the list only if she is at least sixty years old / over sixty years old / sixty years old or more.'\nThe five conditions in v.10 expressed with ει can be understood in two ways. NRSV, ESV, NIV, and Mounce (2000) treat these as an elaboration of the third requisite \"having a reputation for good deeds\"; in this view, the five conditional clauses in v10 describe five examples of good deeds. NASB translates the five conditions in v.10 as continuing the list started in v.9.",

As far as possible, these should be translated using the same conditional construction. Runge (2010) comments on these verses:\n\"The opening chapter of 1 John has a series of conditional frames that allow the writer to quickly switch from one state of affairs to another. Each clause, by changing the condition for the main clause that follows, provides a new perspective on what it means to have fellowship with Jesus. There is noticeable contrast between the clauses based on the semantics of the content, but it is heightened through the use of frames to juxtapose opposite conditions with their correlating consequences. ... The parallel syntax and wording of vv. 6, 8, and 10 help to insure that the reader connects these verses.\"",

This is the interpretation we have followed.\nWhile the overall function of this conditional is to encourage, Haas et al.

These options are reflected in the NIV, ESV and NRSV translations.\n1) The UBS text has ὅτι ἐὰν \"that if\" (this interpretation is also favoured by Kruse (\\2000), but many scholars think that the text should read ὅ τι ἐάν meaning \"whenever\" (Smalley 1984; Marshall 1978a; Stott 1988; Haas et al. 1994; Jobes 2014). Both of these interpretations are possible. Many languages have a construction that can mean both \"if\" and \"when\" depending on the context, and such a construction would be appropriate here. \n2) Stott (1988) and Marshall (1978) state that this verse is intended to comfort a believer who will inevitably have feelings of guilt, and so p modifies the following clause (giving the order p, q).
