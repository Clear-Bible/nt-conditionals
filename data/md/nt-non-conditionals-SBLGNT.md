* ESV, NASB, NIV: "except"
NRSV: "It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot."
NLT similar to NRSV but exceptive clause is lost


## English
q: (it is no longer good for anything)
p: (except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: εἰς οὐδὲν ἰσχύει ἔτι

## Notes
Greek: ει μη 'except'


----------------

# Matt 5:19: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whoever..."
NIV: "anyone who"
NLT: "if you"


## English
NLT:
p: (if you ignore the least commandment
and teach others to do the same)
q: (you will be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃς ἐὰν οὖν λύσῃ μίαν τῶν ἐντολῶν τούτων τῶν ἐλαχίστων καὶ διδάξῃ οὕτως τοὺς ἀνθρώπους
* _q1_: ἐλάχιστος κληθήσεται ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν


## Notes
Greek: ος εαν 'whoever'
This verse (and also Mat 12:32; 16:25; 18:5-6; 20:26-27) compares two different kinds of people. The first kind of person is referred to with the relative pronoun ος and εαν, while the second type of person is referred to with the relative pronoun ος and αν; both mean "whoever". (Parallel passages in Mark's gospel use αν in both clauses.) It is possible in English to treat this as a true conditional and translate "if anyone" or to personalize it, as in the NLT: "if you".

* _q1_: οὕτως καὶ ὑμεῖς ποιεῖτε αὐτοῖς


## Notes
Greek: ὅσα ἐὰν. Here ἐὰν is used to mean "whatever." This word is often used in a non-conditional sense to heighten indefiniteness of the expression.

## Greek (SBLGNT)

----------------

NIV: "everything"

* _q1_: ποιήσατε καὶ τηρεῖτε


## Notes

* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if possible"


## English
p: (if possible)
q: (to lead astray the elect)


## Greek (SBLGNT)

## Notes
See "if possible" constructions. A possible paraphrase is: "If it were possible to deceive the elect, they would do signs and wonders in order to deceive them."


----------------

# Matt 24:28: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "wherever"
NLT: untranslated/"nearby"

q: (let this cup pass from me)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν
* _q1_: παρελθάτω ἀπ ἐμοῦ τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο


## Notes
It seems unlikely that Jesus would have prayed in such a way if he didn't believe there was some possibility - even a very unlikely possibility - that God could take the cup of suffering from him. Alternatively, this could be a politeness strategy. Translator's Notes points out that Jesus is not asking about whether or not it is possible for God (because all things are possible for God) but rather Jesus is requesting God change his plans.
See "if possible" constructions.


----------------

# Matt 26:63: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"
NASB: "whether"


## English
q: (tell us)
p: (if you are the Christ, the Son of God)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἡμῖν εἴπῃς
* _p1_: εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ


## Notes



----------------

# Matt 27:49: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "whether"
NIV: "if"


## English
q: (let us see)
p: (whether Elijah will come to save him)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Ἄφες ἴδωμεν
* _p1_: εἰ ἔρχεται Ἠλίας σώσων αὐτόν


## Notes
This non-conditional functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Mark 2:7: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "but God alone"
NASB "*but God alone" with textual note at *lit. if not one, God
NLT: untranslated ("only God")

p: (but God alone?)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ θεός


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'. Same wording as Mark 10:18.


----------------

# Mark 2:26: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV: "any but the priests"
NASB: "except the priests"
NIV, NLT: untranslated ("only [for] the priests")


## English
q: (which it is not lawful)
p: (for any but the priests to eat)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: φαγεῖν εἰ μὴ τοὺς ἱερεῖς
* _q1_: οὓς οὐκ ἔξεστιν


## Notes

----------------

# Mark 3:2: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV: "whether"
NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"


## English
And they watched Jesus to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ παρετήρουν αὐτὸν εἰ τοῖς σάββασιν θεραπεύσει αὐτόν ἵνα κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ


## Notes
This is non-conditional because the εἰ clause is subordinate to the preceding clause and specifies what they were watching for; εἰ functions as a complementizer. BDAG supports this by citing this verse under the definition 5bα of εἰ, which is a marker of an indirect question (278).


----------------

# Mark 3:28: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whatever"
NIV, NLT: untranslated


## English
q: (all sins will be forgiven the children of man)

Greek: ὅσα ἐὰν 'whatever'


----------------

* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "except"
NIV: "whatever"

q: (except to be made manifest)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἀλλ ἵνα ἔλθῃ εἰς φανερόν
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἵνα φανερωθῇ


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'except'
Although Boyer (1982b:168; 1983:182) claims that this is a true conditional, here it merely means "except", as seen by the close parallel with ἀλλα in the second half of the verse.
Paraphrases (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): 
NIV: For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.
NLT: For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.

## Notes
Greek: ὃ ἐὰν 'whatever'


----------------

# Mark 8:12b: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: negative assertion, untranslated conditional 
ESV: "no sign will be given"


## English
No sign will be given to this generation. 
Lit: 
p: (If will be given to this generation a sign.)
q: missing


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δοθήσεται τῇ γενεᾷ ταύτῃ σημεῖον


## Notes
This construction seems to be a Greek rendering of a frozen Hebrew oath form. It has no q but -Guelich (1989: 415) suggests that there may be an understood "may I die!"


----------------

# Mark 8:14: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NLT: untranslated ("only")
NIV: "except"
NASB: "not...more than"


## English

Do you see anything?
Lit:
p: (If anything you see?)
q: missing


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἴ τι βλέπεις


## Notes
Greek: εἴ τι 'if anything'. There is no two-clause relationship; rather, the phrase εἴ τι simply means "anything." See definition 7 of εἰ in BDAG.


----------------

# Mark 8:35: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "whoever"
NRSV: "those who"
NLT: "if" (both clauses in the verse translated as conditionals, despite Greek lacking a conditional particle)


## English
p1: (whoever would save his life
q1: (will lose it)
p2: (whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s)
q2: (will save it)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃς γὰρ ἐὰν θέλῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ σῶσαι
* _p2_: ὃς δ ἂν ἀπολέσει τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ καὶ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου
* _q1_: ἀπολέσει αὐτήν
* _q2_: σώσει αὐτήν


## Notes
Greek: ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever' (p2 has ὃς ἂν)
Translator's notes treats these as true conditionals.


----------------

# Mark 8:38: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB: "whoever"
NRSV: "those who"
NIV, NLT: "if anyone"


## English
p: (whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation) 
q: (of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels)


## Greek (SBLGNT)

## Notes
Greek: ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever'. 
Translator's notes treats it as a true conditional.


----------------

# Mark 9:9: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "until"


## English
q: (he charged them to tell no one what they had seen)
p: (until the Son of Man had risen from the dead)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὅταν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ
* _q1_: διεστείλατο αὐτοῖς ἵνα μηδενὶ ἃ εἶδον διηγήσωνται


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ ὅταν. This construction is closely related to the usage of εἰ μὴ to mean "except". Here it is used with ὅταν to mean roughly "except when" (Young's Literal Translation) or more naturally "until." This is the only example of εἰ μὴ ὅταν in the NT.


----------------

# Mark 9:18: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "whenever"


## English
p: (whenever it seizes him)

* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἐν προσευχῇ
* _q1_: Τοῦτο τὸ γένος ἐν οὐδενὶ δύναται ἐξελθεῖν


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'
This may need to be translated as a conditional in some languages: "This kind can only be driven out if you pray" (see the first option in Translator's Notes.)


----------------

# Mark 10:2: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: direct speech with no conditional
NASB: indirect speech, "whether"


## English
Some Pharisees... began to question Him
p: (whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἔξεστιν ἀνδρὶ γυναῖκα ἀπολῦσαι
* _q1_: ἐπηρώτων αὐτὸν


## Notes
εἰ here introduces a Yes/No question, which may either be in direct or indirect speech; in English a question in indirect speech can be introduced using 'if' or 'whether' (as in NASB) and εἰ could function here as a complementizer. See BDAG entry εἰ definition 5bα where this verse is cited.

# Mark 10:29-30: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "who"
NASB: "but"
NLT: uses positives: "everyone... will receive..."


## English
q v.29: (there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel’s sake)
p v.30: (but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life)
NLT rephrases the two negatives as positives: "everyone who has given up...for my sake and for the Good News, will receive..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐδείς ἐστιν ὃς ἀφῆκεν οἰκίαν ἢ ἀδελφοὺς ἢ ἀδελφὰς ἢ μητέρα ἢ πατέρα ἢ τέκνα ἢ ἀγροὺς ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ καὶ ἕνεκεν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ λάβῃ ἑκατονταπλασίονα νῦν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ οἰκίας καὶ ἀδελφοὺς καὶ ἀδελφὰς καὶ μητέρας καὶ τέκνα καὶ ἀγροὺς μετὰ διωγμῶν καὶ ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ ζωὴν αἰώνιον

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἄρα τι εὑρήσει ἐν αὐτῇ
* _q1_: καὶ ἰδὼν συκῆν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν ἔχουσαν φύλλα ἦλθεν


## Notes
Greek: εἰ ἄρα 'if perhaps'. Here εἰ introduces a purpose statement, and this non-conditional functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Mark 11:13b: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "nothing but leaves"
NLT: "only leaves"


## English
q: (he found nothing)

p: (if possible, the elect)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατὸν τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς
* _q1_: ἐγερθήσονται γὰρ ψευδόχριστοι καὶ ψευδοπροφῆται καὶ δώσουσιν σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα πρὸς τὸ ἀποπλανᾶν


## Notes
A possible interpretation is: "If it possible to deceive the elect, then the elect may be deceived (by these signs)".
See "if possible" constructions


----------------

* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "but only"
NASB: "but... alone"
NLT: untranslated ("only")


## English

* _q1_: καὶ ὃ ἐποίησεν αὕτη λαληθήσεται εἰς μνημόσυνον αὐτῆς

Greek: ὅπου ἐὰν 'wherever'. This non-conditional functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Mark 14:14: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "wherever"
NIV, NLT: untranslated


## English
p: (and wherever he enters)
q: (say to the master of the house, "The teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat Passover with my disciples?")

* _p1_: ὅπου ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃ
* _q1_: εἴπατε τῷ οἰκοδεσπότῃ ὅτι Ὁ διδάσκαλος λέγει Ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ κατάλυμά μου ὅπου τὸ πάσχα μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν μου φάγω

## English

q: (the hour might pass from him)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν
* _q1_: παρέλθῃ ἀπ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα


## Notes
Boyer notes that this is "not a complete conditional sentence, but an idiomatic parenthetic insertion into a purpose clause" (1981: 87). Here, the insertion of "if possible" seems to express unlikeliness rather than impossibility. (Note how Luke's account has "if willing" functioning the same way and supporting this analysis.) According to this view, Jesus would not have prayed in this way unless he believed there was a possibility, however remote, of its fulfillment. 
Alternatively, Cole argues that while Jesus knows that God can do anything, he also knows that it is indeed impossible for the Messiah to avoid suffering. Translator's Notes states that "if possible" is a mark of Jesus's humility in asking this of the Father; that is, it is a politeness/humility strategy.
See also "if possible" constructions.

# Mark 15:36: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "whether"
NIV: "if"


## English
wait, let us see

NASB: "whomever"
NRSV, NLT, NIV: "anyone"

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ εἰς Σάρεπτα τῆς Σιδωνίας πρὸς γυναῖκα χήραν
* _q1_: καὶ πρὸς οὐδεμίαν αὐτῶν ἐπέμφθη Ἠλίας


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except' is here better translated as "instead" or "but only", as the widow at Zarephath in Sidon was not one of the widows in Israel.


----------------

# Luke 4:27: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NLT: "but (the) only"
NRSV: "except"

p: (but God alone?)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ μόνος ὁ θεός
* _q1_: τίς δύναται ἁμαρτίας ἀφεῖναι


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'. Boyer notes that this is an example of a sub-type of exceptive clause, which poses a rhetorical question, to which the answer is "no one."


----------------

# Luke 6:4: Non-Conditional


* NASB: "except"
ESV, NRSV: "but"
NLT, NIV: untranslated


## English
q: (which is not lawful for any)

## English
And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath.


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: παρετηροῦντο δὲ οἱ γραμματεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι εἰ ἐν τῷ σαββάτῳ θεραπεύει ἵνα εὕρωσιν κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ


## Notes
The use of εἰ here does not connect two related clauses, but introduces a clause describing a possible event; εἰ functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Luke 6:9: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated


## English
I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐπερωτῶ ὑμᾶς εἰ ἔξεστιν τῷ σαββάτῳ ἀγαθοποιῆσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι ψυχὴν σῶσαι ἢ ἀπολέσαι


## Notes
In contrast to 6:7, in this verse εἰ introduces a direct question and states both possible answers.


----------------

# Luke 7:23: Non-Conditional


* ESV: "the one who"
NASB: "he *who" with textual note at *lit. whoever
NIV, NRSV: "anyone who"
NLT: "those who"


## English
q: (and blessed is the one)
p: (who is not offended by me)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃς ἐὰν μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ ἐν ἐμοί
* _q1_: μακάριός ἐστιν


## Notes
Greek: ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever'
Here ὃς ἐὰν is the phrase that is functioning together as "who"/"whoever" and the μὴ is simply modifying the verb.


----------------

# Luke 8:51: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "except"


## English
q: (he allowed no one to enter with him)
p: (except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child)


## Greek (SBLGNT)

## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'.


----------------

* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "whoever"
NLT: "anyone who"


## English
p: (whoever receives this child in my name)
q: (receives me)

p: (and whoever receives me)
q: (receives the one who sent me)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ὃς ἂν δέξηται τοῦτο τὸ παιδίον ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου
* _p2_: καὶ ὃς ἂν ἐμὲ δέξηται
* _q1_: ἐμὲ δέχεται
* _q2_: δέχεται τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με


## Notes
Greek:  ὃς ἐὰν "whoever".
This verse (and also Luk 17:33) compares two different kinds of people. The first kind of person is referred to with the relative pronoun ὃς and ἐὰν, while the second type of person is referred to with the relative pronoun ὃς and ἂν; both mean "whoever". It is possible in English to treat this as a true conditional and translate "if anyone" or, as in the NLT, to personalize it, "if you".


----------------

# Luke 9:57: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "wherever"


## English
q: (I will follow you)
p: (wherever you go)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὅπου ἐὰν ἀπέρχῃ

## Notes
ὅπου ἐὰν 'wherever'; ἐὰν modifies ὅπου to make the locative term indefiinite.

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Πῦρ ἦλθον βαλεῖν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη


## Notes
Marshall notes that this is a Semitism, θέλω εἰ meaning, ‘I wish that’. Possibly εἰ is functioning as a complementizer here.


----------------

# Luke 13:23: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated


## English
"Lord, will those who are saved be few?"


## Greek (SBLGNT)

* _q1_: τίς γὰρ ἐξ ὑμῶν θέλων πύργον οἰκοδομῆσαι οὐχὶ πρῶτον καθίσας ψηφίζει τὴν δαπάνην


## Notes
The use of εἰ here does not connect two related clauses, but introduces an indirect question by introducing a clause describing a possible situation; εἰ functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Luke 14:31: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "whether"


## English
q: (or what king, going out to enounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate)

* _p1_: Εἰ ἔγνως ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ καὶ σὺ τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην νῦν δὲ ἐκρύβη ἀπὸ ὀφθαλμῶν σου


## Notes
This is not a true conditional, as there is no q. Some English translations use "if only" or other expressions to show that this is a lament.

# Luke 22:49: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated


## English
And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν τὸ ἐσόμενον εἶπαν Κύριε εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ


## Notes
The question in Greek begins with εἰ which usually indicates that the question expects an affirmative answer. The disciples therefore seem to expect they should fight back with their swords (and one of them does in fact strike before Jesus answers).


----------------

# Luke 23:06: Non-Conditional


* NASB, ESV, RSV:  "whether"
NIV: "if"
NLT: untranslated, direct quotation


## English
q: (he asked)
p: (whether the man was a Galilean)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν
* _q1_: ἐπηρώτησεν


## Notes
The use of εἰ here does not connect two related clauses, but introduces an indirect question by introducing a clause describing a possible situation; εἰ functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# John 3:13: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "except"
NASB, NLT: "but"


## English
q: (no one has ascended into heaven)
p: (except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀναβέβηκεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὁ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καταβάς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'
Trail notes on this particular verse that "the phrase εἰ μή ‘except’ can introduce an exception to the general idea that has been introduced without providing an exception to what is explicitly stated in the preceding clause. In this verse the connection in English should be ‘but’ rather than ‘except’."


----------------

# John 6:22: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "only"
NASB: "except"


## English
NASB: the crowd ... saw that
p: (there was no other small boat there)
q: (except one)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: πλοιάριον ἄλλο οὐκ ἦν ἐκεῖ
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἕν


## Notes
Greek:εἰ μὴ 'except'
NASB follows the form of the Greek very closely: "there was no other small boat there, except one." Most English translations use 'only', e.g. ESV, NRSV: "there had been only one boat there."


----------------

# John 6:46: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "except"
NLT: "only"


## English

## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'


----------------

# John 9:25: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "whether"


## English
p: (whether he is a sinner)
q: (I do not know)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν
* _q1_: οὐκ οἶδα


## Notes
εἰ here does not connect two related clauses; instead, it introduces an indirect question. Grammatically, εἰ here functions as a complementizer. (In English, 'if' or 'whether' can be used here.)


----------------

# John 10:10: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "only"
NLT: untranslated


## English
q: (the thief comes)
p: (only to steal and kill and destroy)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: εἰ μὴ ἵνα κλέψῃ καὶ θύσῃ καὶ ἀπολέσῃ
* _p1_: ὁ κλέπτης οὐκ ἔρχεται


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'
Greek: "The thief does not come except so that he may steal and kill and destroy." Most English translations use "only".


----------------

# John 13:10: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NLT: "except"
NASB, NIV: "only"


## English
q: (the one who had bathed does not need to wash)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Ὁ λελουμένος οὐκ ἔχει χρείαν … νίψασθαι

## Notes

Some English translations use "only, e.g NASB": "He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet."


----------------

# John 14:6: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "except"
NASB: "but"


## English
q: (no one comes to the Father)

## Notes

----------------

# Acts 1:6: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: direct question


## English
Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom of Israel?


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Κύριε εἰ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ


## Notes



----------------

# Acts 3:23: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB: "every soul who/that"
NRSV: "everyone who"
NIV, NLT: "anyone who"


## English
p: (every soul who does not listen to that prophet)
q: (shall be destroyed from the people)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἔσται δὲ πᾶσα ψυχὴ ἥτις ἂν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου
* _q1_: ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ


## Notes
Greek ἥτις ἐὰν is best translated as a relative pronoun 'who, whoever'. This is a quotation of Deutoronomy 18:19, which in Hebrew is clearly not a condtional construction; however, the LXX uses ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever'.


----------------

# Acts 5:8: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whether"
NIV, NLT: direct question


## English
And Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἀπεκρίθη δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν Πέτρος Εἰπέ μοι εἰ τοσούτου τὸ χωρίον ἀπέδοσθε


## Notes
While some of the English translations treat this more like an indirect question, the UBS Greek text has a question mark at the end of the clause, which indicates that the conditional particle is more likely a direct question marker here.


----------------

# Acts 5:15: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "at least...might"
NRSV: "in order that...might"
NLT:  "so that...might"


## English
as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἵνα ἐρχομένου Πέτρου κἂν ἡ σκιὰ ἐπισκιάσῃ τινὶ αὐτῶν


## Notes
καν is translated as 'at least' in some translations. 
This could be a case of an elipsed q, i.e. "if Peter's shadow fell on them [they would be healed]."


----------------

# Acts 7:1: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: direct question


## English

NLT: not translated


## English
p: (if possible)
so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατόν


## Notes
εἰ δυνατὸν 'if possible'
This is acknowledging the unlikeliness (or impossibility) of living at peace with everyone entirely, since such a thing depends on others "living at peace" as well. The secondary, explanatory caveat "as far as it depends on you," is not what is modified by "if possible." Rather, it is the command to "live at peace" that is modified by both "if possible" and "as far as it depends on you." This additional modifying phrase is what makes this command more likely to be fulfilled than other "if possible" constructions.

* _p1_: εἰ μὴ τῷ λογιζομένῳ τι κοινὸν εἶναι ἐκείνῳ κοινόν


## Notes
εἰ μὴ 'except' is translated simply as 'but' by most English versions; however NIV and NLT have made a conditional with the second half of the verse rather than the first part being q (p: but if anyone regards something as unclean, q: then for that person it is unclean)

* _q1_: εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ καὶ ἔγραψα ἵνα γνῶ τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν


## Notes
εἰ introduces a question that is a dependent clause (the main clause has the verb 'know', so εἰ is functioning grammatically as a complementizer).


----------------

# 2 Cor 3:15: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whenever"
NIV, NLT: "when"


## English
p: (whenever Moses is read)
q: (a veil lies over their hearts)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἂν ἀναγινώσκηται Μωϋσῆς
* _q1_: κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν κεῖται


## Notes
Verses 15 and 16 should be considered together. While v.15 contains the particle αν and v.16 contains the particle εαν, each has ηνικα "when" functioning together with the conditional particle to create a "whenever" sense in English.

ESV, NRSV: "when"


## English

* _p1_: εἴ γε καὶ ἐνδυσάμενοι οὐ γυμνοὶ εὑρεθησόμεθα


## Notes
There is a wide range of translations of the phrase εἴ γε καὶ, indicating a lack of consensus on how it is excactly being used. There does not appear to be a clear conditional relationship between p and q.

## Notes
The Greek phrase καθὸ ἐὰν has the sense of "according to"

## Notes
εἰ introduces a question that is a dependent clause (the main clause has the verb πειράζετε 'test' in Greek and 'see' in English, so εἰ is functioning grammatically as a complementizer).

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ γε ἠκούσατε τὴν οἰκονομίαν τῆς χάριτος τοῦ θεοῦ τῆς δοθείσης μοι εἰς ὑμᾶς


## Notes
εἴ γε 'if indeed'
Some commentators (Hoehner 2008; Arnold 2010) suggest that p consists of vs.2-12, and q is v.13. However, most translations do not treat this as a genuine conditional; Translator's Notes accepts the NIV's "surely" and states, "Paul was saying that he was sure that the Ephesian believers knew of his ministry of preaching the gospel."


----------------

NASB, NIV: "except"

## English
p: (so that whether I come and see you or am absent)
q: (I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for faith of the gospel)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἵνα εἴτε ἐλθὼν καὶ ἰδὼν ὑμᾶς εἴτε ἀπὼν
* _q1_: ἀκούω τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν ὅτι στήκετε ἐν ἑνὶ πνεύματι μιᾷ ψυχῇ συναθλοῦντες τῇ πίστει τοῦ εὐαγγελίου

## English
p: (that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ πως καταντήσω εἰς τὴν ἐξανάστασιν τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν


## Notes
Greek: ει πως + subjunctive ('if somehow I may')
The conditional is not "If I atttain resurrection from the dead" but "If there are any means possible by which I can attain resurrection of the dead" the latter which we know to be true. Thus Paul is not arguing that he has for certain gained resurrection from the dead, but that since it is a possibility he will do anything and everything to attain it.


----------------

# Phil 3:12: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: (in order) "to" 
NASB: "so that"


## English
q: (but I press on)
p: (to make it my own)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: διώκω δὲ
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ καταλάβω


## Notes
Greek εἰ καὶ 'even if, if indeed'
"it" refers to the righteousness which Paul talks about in 3:8-11, that he is working towards but has not yet attained.


----------------

# Phil 4:15: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "except"
NASB: "but"

p: (whether we are awake or asleep)
q: ([Jesus] died for us so that ... we might live with him)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴτε γρηγορῶμεν εἴτε καθεύδωμεν
* _q1_: τοῦ ἀποθανόντος … ἡμῶν ἵνα … ἅμα σὺν αὐτῷ ζήσωμεν


## Notes
εἴτε
The conditionals "if we are awake or if we are asleep..." state that being alive or asleep (i.e. dead) makes no difference; we will live with him in either case. This can be expressed in English as 'whether we are alive or asleep/dead' or 'even if we are alive and even if we are asleep, we will live with him.'
This is an ‘alternative concessive conditional’ construction, in which the two 'conditional' clauses present an exhaustive set of alternatives, in this case being alive or being dead.

* ESV: "since"
NASB: "after all"
NRSV: "indeed"

* _p1_: εἴπερ δίκαιον παρὰ θεῷ ἀνταποδοῦναι τοῖς θλίβουσιν ὑμᾶς θλῖψιν καὶ ὑμῖν τοῖς θλιβομένοις ἄνεσιν μεθ ἡμῶν


## Notes
εἴπερ 'since, if indeed'


----------------

# 2 Thess 2:15: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NRSV: "either... or"
NASB, NIV: "whether... or"
NLT: "both... and"


## English
q: (stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us...)
p: (...either by our spoken word or by our letter)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: στήκετε καὶ κρατεῖτε τὰς παραδόσεις ἃς ἐδιδάχθητε
* _p1_: εἴτε διὰ λόγου εἴτε δι ἐπιστολῆς ἡμῶν


## Notes
εἴτε appears before 'word' and 'letter'


----------------

# 1 Tim 1:9-10: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "whatever else"
NLT: "anything else"


## English
q: (the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and the sinners, for the unholy and the profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers)
p: (and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: εἰδὼς τοῦτο ὅτι δικαίῳ νόμος οὐ κεῖται ἀνόμοις δὲ καὶ ἀνυποτάκτοις ἀσεβέσι καὶ ἁμαρτωλοῖς ἀνοσίοις καὶ βεβήλοις πατρολῴαις καὶ μητρολῴαις ἀνδροφόνοις πόρνοις ἀρσενοκοίταις ἀνδραποδισταῖς ψεύσταις ἐπιόρκοις
* _p1_: εἴ τι ἕτερον τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ ἀντίκειται


## Notes
Greek: εἴ τι ἕτερον 'if any other thing'. This does not state a condition under which q holds, but rather ει τι functions as an indefinite pronoun. Similar to 2Co 2:10, 7:14.


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:5: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Neutral
* Time Orientation: Gnomic
* Illocutionary Force: Exhort
* ESV, NLT: no conditional / "unless"
NASB: "if anyone" / "unless"
NRSV: "in the case of" / "without"
NIV: "anyone who" / "except by"


## English
NASB (following Greek closely):
p1: (if anyone competes as an athlete,)
q1: (q2: [he does not win the prize] p2: [unless he competes according to the rules.])

ESV: 
q: (An athlete is not crowned)
p: (unless he competes according to the rules)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ καὶ ἀθλῇ τις … ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ
* _q1_: οὐ στεφανοῦται


## Notes
This verse is grammatically complex because it has a conditional embedded within another conditional. Most translations simplify the grammar in some way. The first p seems to be presentational, introducing the topic of athletes, so in that sense, 2:5b-c is the true conditional (see ESV).
Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless'):
p1 (if anyone competes as an athlete,) q1: (q2: [he wins the prize] p2: [only if he competes according to the rules.])
or:
q: (an athlete wins the prize) p: [only if he competes according to the rules.)


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:11: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Factual
* Time Orientation: Past
* Illocutionary Force: Encourage
* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## English
p: (If we have died with him,)
q: (we will also live with him)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ συναπεθάνομεν
* _q1_: καὶ συζήσομεν


## Notes
The conditionals of 2:11-13 are a Christian hymn modified by Paul for this context, rather than a logical argument .
2Ti 2:11 is very similar to Rom 6:8. Given the connection with baptism in Romans 6, Paul's theology, and the fact that this p is in the aorist, this is clearly a factual conditional.


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:12a: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Neutral
* Time Orientation: Gnomic
* Illocutionary Force: Exhort / Warn
* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## English
p: (if we endure,)
q: (we will also reign with him)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὑπομένομεν
* _q1_: καὶ συμβασιλεύσομεν


## Notes
Mounce (2000) claims that there is an implied warning in this verse. Unlike v.11, the final three conditionals in this hymn have a neutral probability.


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:12b: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Neutral
* Time Orientation: Gnomic
* Illocutionary Force: Warn
* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## English
p: (if we deny him,)
q: (he also will deny us;)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα
* _q1_: κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται ἡμᾶς


## Notes
Mounce (2000) claims that 2:12b refers to total apostasy whereas 2:13 refers to temporary disobedience.


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:13: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Neutral
* Time Orientation: Gnomic
* Illocutionary Force: Encourage
* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## English
p: (if we are faithless,)
q: (he remains faithful)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἀπιστοῦμεν
* _q1_: ἐκεῖνος πιστὸς μένει


## Notes
See note at 2:12b.
Q is true regardless of the validity of p, so this could be interpreted as a concessive condtional: "even if we are are unfaithful, he remains faithful."


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:21: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Neutral
* Time Orientation: Gnomic
* Illocutionary Force: Encourage
* ESV, NASB: "if anyone'"
NRSV: "all who"
NIV: "those who"
NLT: "if you"


## English
p: (if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable,)
q: (he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὖν τις ἐκκαθάρῃ ἑαυτὸν ἀπὸ τούτων
* _q1_: ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν ἡγιασμένον εὔχρηστον τῷ δεσπότῃ εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἡτοιμασμένον


## Notes
This conditional introduces the topic of people who are cleansed from moral wrong.


----------------

# Titus 1:6: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Neutral
* Time Orientation: Present
* Illocutionary Force: Assert
* ESV: "if anyone"
NASB: "if any man"
NRSV: "someone who"
NIV, NLT: no conditional, "an elder must..."


## English
p: (...if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination)
q: (IMPLIED: appoint such a person)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἀνέγκλητος μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἀνήρ τέκνα ἔχων πιστά μὴ ἐν κατηγορίᾳ ἀσωτίας ἢ ἀνυπότακτα


## Notes
Paul is giving Titus a guideline for appointing elders. This conditional lists the attributes of an elder; however, q is left implicit. The conditional expression εἴ τίς 'if anyone' can equally well be treated as an indefinite pronoun as in NRSV "someone".


----------------

# Phlm 1:17: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Factual
* Time Orientation: Present
* Illocutionary Force: Request
* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## English
p: (so if you consider me your partner)
q: (receive him as you would receive me)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ οὖν με ἔχεις κοινωνόν
* _q1_: προσλαβοῦ αὐτὸν ὡς ἐμέ


## Notes
Philemon knows that Paul considers him a partner. Paul is making his request on the basis of that relationship.


----------------

# Phlm 1:18: Non-Conditional


* Probability: Very Likely or Factual
* Time Orientation: Present
* Illocutionary Force: Command
* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## English
p: (if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything)
q: (charge that to my account)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τι ἠδίκησέν σε ἢ ὀφείλει
* _q1_: τοῦτο ἐμοὶ ἐλλόγα


## Notes
Paul is sending Onesimus, a slave, back to Philemon, his master. It is highly likely that Philemon feels that Onesimus has done him wrong. By asking Philemon to charge everything owed to his (Paul's) account, Paul is taking on the responsibility for paying what Onesimus owes.


----------------

# Heb 3:11: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated/paraphrased


## English
p: (they shall not enter my rest)
q: omitted


## Greek (SBLGNT)

## Notes
εἰ has the force of an emphatic negative. There is no q; this may be a Hebraism (Elliot).

NRSV, NIV: "if not to"

----------------

# Heb 6:14: Non-Conditional


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated/paraphrased


## English
p: (surely I will bless you and multiply you)
q: (omitted)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ μὴν εὐλογῶν εὐλογήσω σε καὶ πληθύνων πληθυνῶ σε


## Notes
Εἰ μὴν has the force of 'surely'. There is no q; this may be a Hebraism (Elliot).

## Greek (SBLGNT)
