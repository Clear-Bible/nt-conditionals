* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (it is no longer good for anything)
<br/>p: (except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "except"
* NRSV: "It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot."
* NLT similar to NRSV but exceptive clause is lost


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: εἰς οὐδὲν ἰσχύει ἔτι
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ βληθὲν ἔξω καταπατεῖσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων


## Notes
Greek: ει μη 'except'


----------------

# Matt 5:19




## English
NLT:
<br/>p: (if you ignore the least commandment
<br/>and teach others to do the same)
<br/>q: (you will be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whoever..."
* NIV: "anyone who"
* NLT: "if you"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃς ἐὰν οὖν λύσῃ μίαν τῶν ἐντολῶν τούτων τῶν ἐλαχίστων καὶ διδάξῃ οὕτως τοὺς ἀνθρώπους
* _q1_: ἐλάχιστος κληθήσεται ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν


## Notes
Greek: ος εαν 'whoever'

This verse (and also Mat 12:32; 16:25; 18:5-6; 20:26-27) compares two different kinds of people. The first kind of person is referred to with the relative pronoun ος and εαν, while the second type of person is referred to with the relative pronoun ος and αν; both mean "whoever". (Parallel passages in Mark's gospel use αν in both clauses.) It is possible in English to treat this as a true conditional and translate "if anyone" or to personalize it, as in the NLT: "if you".

## English
p: (whoever marries a divorced woman)
<br/>q: (commits adultery)

# Matt 7:12




## English
p: (so whatever you wish that others would do to you)

* ESV: "whatever"
* NASB: "in everything...treat people the same way..."
* NRSV: "In everything do to others as you would have them do to you"
* NIV: similar to NRSV
* NLT: p and q inverted, "whatever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Πάντα οὖν ὅσα ἐὰν θέλητε ἵνα ποιῶσιν ὑμῖν οἱ ἄνθρωποι
* _q1_: οὕτως καὶ ὑμεῖς ποιεῖτε αὐτοῖς


## Notes
Greek: ὅσα ἐὰν. Here ἐὰν is used to mean "whatever." This word is often used in a non-conditional sense to heighten indefiniteness of the expression.


----------------

## English
q: ("Teacher, I will follow you)
<br/>p: (wherever you go")


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "wherever"

----------------

# Matt 12:10




## English
And they asked him "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ ἐπηρώτησαν αὐτὸν λέγοντες Εἰ ἔξεστι τοῖς σάββασιν


## Notes
Elliot lists this verse as a prime example of introducing direct speech, ει serving as an equivalent of quotation marks in English.

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἔξεστιν ἀνθρώπῳ ἀπολῦσαι τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ κατὰ πᾶσαν αἰτίαν

This usage of εἰ is not conditional but is the marker of a Yes/No question in indirect speech, much like the English usage of "if" meaning "whether."

----------------

# Matt 23:3




## English

* ESV, NRSV, NLT: "whatever"

* NIV: "everything"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: πάντα οὖν ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπωσιν ὑμῖν
* _q1_: ποιήσατε καὶ τηρεῖτε


## Notes
Greek: πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν

As noted on 22:9, Osbourne takes this phrase as an idiomatic expression. He says this "stong 'everything' seems to mean 'every' area of life."

See "if possible" constructions. A possible paraphrase is: "If it were possible to deceive the elect, they would do signs and wonders in order to deceive them."


----------------

# Matt 24:28




## English

## Notes
Greek: ὅπου ἐὰν. This phrase is translated together as "wherever". (See also Mat 8:19.)

# Matt 26:39


* **Class:** 1


## English
p: (if it be possible)
<br/>q: (let this cup pass from me)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν
* _q1_: παρελθάτω ἀπ ἐμοῦ τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο


## Notes
It seems unlikely that Jesus would have prayed in such a way if he didn't believe there was some possibility - even a very unlikely possibility - that God could take the cup of suffering from him. Alternatively, this could be a politeness strategy. Translator's Notes points out that Jesus is not asking about whether or not it is possible for God (because all things are possible for God) but rather Jesus is requesting God change his plans.

See "if possible" constructions.

* _p1_: εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ


----------------

# Matt 27:49


* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (let us see)
<br/>p: (whether Elijah will come to save him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NLT: "whether"
* NIV: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Ἄφες ἴδωμεν
* _p1_: εἰ ἔρχεται Ἠλίας σώσων αὐτόν


## Notes
This non-conditional functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Mark 2:7


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (who can forgive sins)
<br/>p: (but God alone?)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "but God alone"
* NASB "*but God alone" with textual note at *lit. if not one, God
* NLT: untranslated ("only God")


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας

## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'. Same wording as Mark 10:18.

## English

# Mark 3:2


* **Class:** 1


## English
And they watched Jesus to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.


* ESV, NRSV: "whether"
* NASB, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: καὶ παρετήρουν αὐτὸν εἰ τοῖς σάββασιν θεραπεύσει αὐτόν ἵνα κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ


## Notes
This is non-conditional because the εἰ clause is subordinate to the preceding clause and specifies what they were watching for; εἰ functions as a complementizer. BDAG supports this by citing this verse under the definition 5bα of εἰ, which is a marker of an indirect question (278).


----------------

# Mark 3:28


* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (all sins will be forgiven the children of man)
<br/>p: (and whatever blasphemies they utter)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whatever"

* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (for nothing is hidden)
<br/>q: (except to be made manifest)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "except"

* NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἀλλ ἵνα ἔλθῃ εἰς φανερόν
* _p1_: ἐὰν μὴ ἵνα φανερωθῇ


## Notes
Greek: ἐὰν μὴ 'except'

Although Boyer (1982b:168; 1983:182) claims that this is a true conditional, here it merely means "except", as seen by the close parallel with ἀλλα in the second half of the verse.

Paraphrases (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): 

NIV: For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.

NLT: For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.

No sign will be given to this generation. 
<br/>Lit: 
<br/>p: (If will be given to this generation a sign.)
<br/>q: missing


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: negative assertion, untranslated conditional 
* ESV: "no sign will be given"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δοθήσεται τῇ γενεᾷ ταύτῃ σημεῖον


## Notes
This construction seems to be a Greek rendering of a frozen Hebrew oath form. It has no q but -Guelich (1989: 415) suggests that there may be an understood "may I die!"


----------------

# Mark 8:14


* **Class:** 1


## English

* **Class:** 3


## English
p1: (whoever would save his life
<br/>q1: (will lose it)
<br/>p2: (whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s)
<br/>q2: (will save it)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "whoever"
* NRSV: "those who"
* NLT: "if" (both clauses in the verse translated as conditionals, despite Greek lacking a conditional particle)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃς γὰρ ἐὰν θέλῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ σῶσαι
* _p2_: ὃς δ ἂν ἀπολέσει τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ καὶ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου
* _q1_: ἀπολέσει αὐτήν
* _q2_: σώσει αὐτήν


## Notes
Greek: ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever' (p2 has ὃς ἂν)

Translator's notes treats these as true conditionals.


----------------

# Mark 8:38


* **Class:** 3


## English
p: (whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation) 
<br/>q: (of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels)


* ESV, NASB: "whoever"
* NRSV: "those who"
* NIV, NLT: "if anyone"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃς γὰρ ἐὰν ἐπαισχυνθῇ με καὶ τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους ἐν τῇ γενεᾷ ταύτῃ τῇ μοιχαλίδι καὶ ἁμαρτωλῷ

## Notes
Greek: ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever'. 

Translator's notes treats it as a true conditional.


----------------

# Mark 9:9


* **Class:** 1


## English
q: (he charged them to tell no one what they had seen)
<br/>p: (until the Son of Man had risen from the dead)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "until"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὅταν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ
* _q1_: διεστείλατο αὐτοῖς ἵνα μηδενὶ ἃ εἶδον διηγήσωνται


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ ὅταν. This construction is closely related to the usage of εἰ μὴ to mean "except". Here it is used with ὅταν to mean roughly "except when" (Young's Literal Translation) or more naturally "until." This is the only example of εἰ μὴ ὅταν in the NT.


----------------

# Mark 9:18




## English
p: (whenever it seizes him)
<br/>q: (it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἐν προσευχῇ
* _q1_: Τοῦτο τὸ γένος ἐν οὐδενὶ δύναται ἐξελθεῖν


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'

This may need to be translated as a conditional in some languages: "This kind can only be driven out if you pray" (see the first option in Translator's Notes.)


----------------

# Mark 10:2




## English
Some Pharisees... began to question Him
<br/>p: (whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: direct speech with no conditional
* NASB: indirect speech, "whether"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἔξεστιν ἀνδρὶ γυναῖκα ἀπολῦσαι
* _q1_: ἐπηρώτων αὐτὸν


## Notes
εἰ here introduces a Yes/No question, which may either be in direct or indirect speech; in English a question in indirect speech can be introduced using 'if' or 'whether' (as in NASB) and εἰ could function here as a complementizer. See BDAG entry εἰ definition 5bα where this verse is cited.

* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q v.29: (there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel’s sake)
<br/>p v.30: (but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life)
<br/>NLT rephrases the two negatives as positives: "everyone who has given up...for my sake and for the Good News, will receive..."


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "who"
* NASB: "but"
* NLT: uses positives: "everyone... will receive..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐδείς ἐστιν ὃς ἀφῆκεν οἰκίαν ἢ ἀδελφοὺς ἢ ἀδελφὰς ἢ μητέρα ἢ πατέρα ἢ τέκνα ἢ ἀγροὺς ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ καὶ ἕνεκεν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου

<br/>p: (if he could find anything on it)


* ESV, NIV, NLT: "if"
* NASB: "if perhaps"
* NRSV: "whether"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἄρα τι εὑρήσει ἐν αὐτῇ
* _q1_: καὶ ἰδὼν συκῆν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν ἔχουσαν φύλλα ἦλθεν


## Notes
Greek: εἰ ἄρα 'if perhaps'. Here εἰ introduces a purpose statement, and this non-conditional functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Mark 11:13b




## English
q: (he found nothing)
<br/>p: (but leaves)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "nothing but leaves"

* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "to lead astray, if possible..."
* NIV, NLT: "to deceive, if possible, even..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατὸν τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς
* _q1_: ἐγερθήσονται γὰρ ψευδόχριστοι καὶ ψευδοπροφῆται καὶ δώσουσιν σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα πρὸς τὸ ἀποπλανᾶν


## Notes
A possible interpretation is: "If it possible to deceive the elect, then the elect may be deceived (by these signs)".

* _q1_: καὶ ὃ ἐποίησεν αὕτη λαληθήσεται εἰς μνημόσυνον αὐτῆς


## Notes
Greek: ὅπου ἐὰν 'wherever'. This non-conditional functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Mark 14:14




## English
p: (and wherever he enters)
<br/>q: (say to the master of the house, "The teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat Passover with my disciples?")


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "wherever"
* NIV, NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὅπου ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃ
* _q1_: εἴπατε τῷ οἰκοδεσπότῃ ὅτι Ὁ διδάσκαλος λέγει Ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ κατάλυμά μου ὅπου τὸ πάσχα μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν μου φάγω

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν
* _q1_: παρέλθῃ ἀπ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα


## Notes
Boyer notes that this is "not a complete conditional sentence, but an idiomatic parenthetic insertion into a purpose clause" (1981: 87). Here, the insertion of "if possible" seems to express unlikeliness rather than impossibility. (Note how Luke's account has "if willing" functioning the same way and supporting this analysis.) According to this view, Jesus would not have prayed in this way unless he believed there was a possibility, however remote, of its fulfillment. 

Alternatively, Cole argues that while Jesus knows that God can do anything, he also knows that it is indeed impossible for the Messiah to avoid suffering. Translator's Notes states that "if possible" is a mark of Jesus's humility in asking this of the Father; that is, it is a politeness/humility strategy.

See also "if possible" constructions.

wait, let us see

## English
To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I will give it to whom I will.


* ESV: "whom"
* NASB: "whomever"
* NRSV, NLT, NIV: "anyone"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Σοὶ δώσω τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην ἅπασαν καὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν ὅτι ἐμοὶ παραδέδοται καὶ ᾧ ἂν θέλω δίδωμι αὐτήν

* ESV, NASB: "but only"
* NRSV: "except"
* NIV: "but"
* NLT: "instead"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ εἰς Σάρεπτα τῆς Σιδωνίας πρὸς γυναῖκα χήραν
* _q1_: καὶ πρὸς οὐδεμίαν αὐτῶν ἐπέμφθη Ἠλίας


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except' is here better translated as "instead" or "but only", as the widow at Zarephath in Sidon was not one of the widows in Israel.


----------------

# Luke 4:27




## English
q: (and none of them was cleansed)
<br/>p: (but only Naaman the Syrian)


* ESV, NASB, NLT: "but (the) only"
* NRSV: "except"
* NIV: "only"


## Greek (SBLGNT)

## English
q: (who can forgive sins)

* NLT: untranslated ("only God")


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ μόνος ὁ θεός
* _q1_: τίς δύναται ἁμαρτίας ἀφεῖναι


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'. Boyer notes that this is an example of a sub-type of exceptive clause, which poses a rhetorical question, to which the answer is "no one."


----------------

# Luke 6:4


* **Class:** 1


## English
q: (which is not lawful for any)
<br/>p: (but the priests to eat)


* NASB: "except"

# Luke 6:7




## English
And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath.


* ESV, NRSV: "whether"
* NASB, NIV: "if"
* NLT: "if" (uses prototypical conditional construction)


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: παρετηροῦντο δὲ οἱ γραμματεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι εἰ ἐν τῷ σαββάτῳ θεραπεύει ἵνα εὕρωσιν κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ


## Notes
The use of εἰ here does not connect two related clauses, but introduces a clause describing a possible event; εἰ functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Luke 6:9




## English
I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἐπερωτῶ ὑμᾶς εἰ ἔξεστιν τῷ σαββάτῳ ἀγαθοποιῆσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι ψυχὴν σῶσαι ἢ ἀπολέσαι


## Notes
In contrast to 6:7, in this verse εἰ introduces a direct question and states both possible answers.


----------------

# Luke 7:23




## English
q: (and blessed is the one)
<br/>p: (who is not offended by me)


* ESV: "the one who"
* NASB: "he *who" with textual note at *lit. whoever
* NIV, NRSV: "anyone who"
* NLT: "those who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃς ἐὰν μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ ἐν ἐμοί
* _q1_: μακάριός ἐστιν


## Notes
Greek: ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever'

Here ὃς ἐὰν is the phrase that is functioning together as "who"/"whoever" and the μὴ is simply modifying the verb.


----------------

# Luke 8:51


* **Class:** 1


## English
q: (he allowed no one to enter with him)
<br/>p: (except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "except"


## Greek (SBLGNT)

## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'.


----------------

# Luke 9:48




## English
p: (whoever receives this child in my name)
<br/>q: (receives me)
<br/>
<br/>p: (and whoever receives me)
<br/>q: (receives the one who sent me)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "whoever"
* NLT: "anyone who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ὃς ἂν δέξηται τοῦτο τὸ παιδίον ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου
* _p2_: καὶ ὃς ἂν ἐμὲ δέξηται
* _q1_: ἐμὲ δέχεται
* _q2_: δέχεται τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με


## Notes
Greek:  ὃς ἐὰν "whoever".

This verse (and also Luk 17:33) compares two different kinds of people. The first kind of person is referred to with the relative pronoun ὃς and ἐὰν, while the second type of person is referred to with the relative pronoun ὃς and ἂν; both mean "whoever". It is possible in English to treat this as a true conditional and translate "if anyone" or, as in the NLT, to personalize it, "if you".


----------------

## English
q: (I will follow you)
<br/>p: (wherever you go)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "wherever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὅπου ἐὰν ἀπέρχῃ
* _q1_: Ἀκολουθήσω σοι


## Notes
ὅπου ἐὰν 'wherever'; ἐὰν modifies ὅπου to make the locative term indefiinite.

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Πῦρ ἦλθον βαλεῖν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη


## Notes
Marshall notes that this is a Semitism, θέλω εἰ meaning, ‘I wish that’. Possibly εἰ is functioning as a complementizer here.


----------------

## English
"Lord, will those who are saved be few?"


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)

* _q1_: τίς γὰρ ἐξ ὑμῶν θέλων πύργον οἰκοδομῆσαι οὐχὶ πρῶτον καθίσας ψηφίζει τὴν δαπάνην


## Notes
The use of εἰ here does not connect two related clauses, but introduces an indirect question by introducing a clause describing a possible situation; εἰ functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# Luke 14:31




## English
q: (or what king, going out to enounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate)
<br/>p: (whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?)

* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος
* _q1_: οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες δοῦναι δόξαν τῷ θεῷ


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'


----------------

# Luke 17:33




## English
p: (whoever seeks to preserve his life)
<br/>q: (will lose it)
<br/>
<br/>p: (but whoever loses his life)
<br/>q: (will keep it)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "whoever"
* NRSV: "those who"
* NLT: "if you"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃς ἐὰν ζητήσῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ περιποιήσασθαι
* _p2_: ὃς δ ἂν ἀπολέσῃ
* _q1_: ἀπολέσει αὐτήν
* _q2_: ζῳογονήσει αὐτήν


## Notes
Greek: ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever'; Luke 9:24 is almost identical but uses ἂν in both clauses.

See note on 9:48.


----------------

# Luke 18:19




## English
q: (no one is good)
<br/>p: (except God alone)


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "except"
* NRSV: "but"
* NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ θεός
* _q1_: οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'


----------------

# Luke 19:42




## English
NASB:
<br/>p: (If you had known this day, even you, the things which make for peace)
<br/>q: [elided]


* ESV: "would that..."
* NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if...(only)"
* NLT: "how I wish..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἔγνως ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ καὶ σὺ τὰ πρὸς εἰρήνην νῦν δὲ ἐκρύβη ἀπὸ ὀφθαλμῶν σου


## Notes
This is not a true conditional, as there is no q. Some English translations use "if only" or other expressions to show that this is a lament.


----------------

# Luke 22:49




## English
And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν τὸ ἐσόμενον εἶπαν Κύριε εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ


## Notes
The question in Greek begins with εἰ which usually indicates that the question expects an affirmative answer. The disciples therefore seem to expect they should fight back with their swords (and one of them does in fact strike before Jesus answers).


----------------

# Luke 23:06




## English
q: (he asked)
<br/>p: (whether the man was a Galilean)


* NASB, ESV, RSV:  "whether"
* NIV: "if"
* NLT: untranslated, direct quotation


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν
* _q1_: ἐπηρώτησεν


## Notes
The use of εἰ here does not connect two related clauses, but introduces an indirect question by introducing a clause describing a possible situation; εἰ functions as a complementizer.


----------------

# John 3:13


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (no one has ascended into heaven)
<br/>p: (except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV: "except"
* NASB, NLT: "but"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀναβέβηκεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὁ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καταβάς ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'

Trail notes on this particular verse that "the phrase εἰ μή ‘except’ can introduce an exception to the general idea that has been introduced without providing an exception to what is explicitly stated in the preceding clause. In this verse the connection in English should be ‘but’ rather than ‘except’."


----------------

# John 6:22


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
NASB: the crowd ... saw that
<br/>p: (there was no other small boat there)
<br/>q: (except one)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "only"
* NASB: "except"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: πλοιάριον ἄλλο οὐκ ἦν ἐκεῖ
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ἕν


## Notes
Greek:εἰ μὴ 'except'

NASB follows the form of the Greek very closely: "there was no other small boat there, except one." Most English translations use 'only', e.g. ESV, NRSV: "there had been only one boat there."


----------------

# John 6:46


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (not that anyone has seen the Father)
<br/>p: (except he who is from God)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "except"
* NLT: "only"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐχ ὅτι τὸν πατέρα ἑώρακέν τις
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὁ ὢν παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'


----------------

# John 9:25


* **Class:** 1


## English
p: (whether he is a sinner)
<br/>q: (I do not know)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "whether"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν
* _q1_: οὐκ οἶδα


## Notes
εἰ here does not connect two related clauses; instead, it introduces an indirect question. Grammatically, εἰ here functions as a complementizer. (In English, 'if' or 'whether' can be used here.)


----------------

# John 10:10


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (the thief comes)
<br/>p: (only to steal and kill and destroy)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "only"
* NLT: untranslated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: εἰ μὴ ἵνα κλέψῃ καὶ θύσῃ καὶ ἀπολέσῃ
* _p1_: ὁ κλέπτης οὐκ ἔρχεται


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'

Greek: "The thief does not come except so that he may steal and kill and destroy." Most English translations use "only".


----------------

# John 13:10


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (the one who had bathed does not need to wash)
<br/>p: (except for his feet)


* ESV, NRSV, NLT: "except"
* NASB, NIV: "only"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Ὁ λελουμένος οὐκ ἔχει χρείαν … νίψασθαι
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ τοὺς πόδας


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'

Some English translations use "only, e.g NASB": "He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet."


----------------

# John 14:6


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (no one comes to the Father)
<br/>p: (except through me)


* ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT: "except"
* NASB: "but"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐδεὶς ἔρχεται πρὸς τὸν πατέρα

## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'


----------------

# John 15:7b

## English
p: (ask whatever you wish)
<br/>q: (and it will be done for you)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "whatever"
* NLT: "anything"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ὃ ἐὰν θέλητε αἰτήσασθε
* _q1_: καὶ γενήσεται ὑμῖν


## Notes
Greek: ὃ ἐὰν 'whatever'


----------------

<br/>p: (except the son of destruction)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "except"
* NASB: "but"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: οὐδεὶς ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀπώλετο
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ ὁ υἱὸς τῆς ἀπωλείας


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'


----------------

# John 19:15


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (we have no king)
<br/>p: (but Caesar)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "but"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: Οὐκ ἔχομεν βασιλέα
* _p1_: εἰ μὴ Καίσαρα


## Notes
Greek: εἰ μὴ 'except'


----------------

# Acts 1:6




## English
Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom of Israel?


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: direct question


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Κύριε εἰ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ


----------------

# Acts 3:23




## English
p: (every soul who does not listen to that prophet)
<br/>q: (shall be destroyed from the people)


* ESV, NASB: "every soul who/that"
* NRSV: "everyone who"
* NIV, NLT: "anyone who"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἔσται δὲ πᾶσα ψυχὴ ἥτις ἂν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου
* _q1_: ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ


## Notes
Greek ἥτις ἐὰν is best translated as a relative pronoun 'who, whoever'. This is a quotation of Deutoronomy 18:19, which in Hebrew is clearly not a condtional construction; however, the LXX uses ὃς ἐὰν 'whoever'.


----------------

# Acts 5:8




## English
And Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much"


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whether"
* NIV, NLT: direct question


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἀπεκρίθη δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν Πέτρος Εἰπέ μοι εἰ τοσούτου τὸ χωρίον ἀπέδοσθε


## Notes
While some of the English translations treat this more like an indirect question, the UBS Greek text has a question mark at the end of the clause, which indicates that the conditional particle is more likely a direct question marker here.


----------------

# Acts 5:15




## English
as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them


* ESV, NASB, NIV: "at least...might"
* NRSV: "in order that...might"
* NLT:  "so that...might"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἵνα ἐρχομένου Πέτρου κἂν ἡ σκιὰ ἐπισκιάσῃ τινὶ αὐτῶν


## Notes
καν is translated as 'at least' in some translations. 

This could be a case of an elipsed q, i.e. "if Peter's shadow fell on them [they would be healed]."


----------------

# Acts 7:1




## English
And the high priest said, "Are these things so?"


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: direct question

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ᾧ ἐὰν ἐπιθῶ τὰς χεῖρας
* _q1_: λαμβάνῃ πνεῦμα ἅγιον


## Notes
Greek: ᾧ ἐὰν 'whomever'

## Greek (SBLGNT)

# Rom 11:6b

# Rom 12:18


* **Class:** 1


## English
p: (if possible)
<br/>so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "if"
* NLT: not translated


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δυνατόν


## Notes
εἰ δυνατὸν 'if possible'

This is acknowledging the unlikeliness (or impossibility) of living at peace with everyone entirely, since such a thing depends on others "living at peace" as well. The secondary, explanatory caveat "as far as it depends on you," is not what is modified by "if possible." Rather, it is the command to "live at peace" that is modified by both "if possible" and "as far as it depends on you." This additional modifying phrase is what makes this command more likely to be fulfilled than other "if possible" constructions.

## Notes
εἰ μὴ 'except' is translated simply as 'but' by most English versions; however NIV and NLT have made a conditional with the second half of the verse rather than the first part being q (p: but if anyone regards something as unclean, q: then for that person it is unclean)

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ εἰς πάντα ὑπήκοοί ἐστε
* _q1_: εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ καὶ ἔγραψα ἵνα γνῶ τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν


## Notes
εἰ introduces a question that is a dependent clause (the main clause has the verb 'know', so εἰ is functioning grammatically as a complementizer).


----------------

# 2 Cor 3:15


* **Class:** 3


## English
p: (whenever Moses is read)
<br/>q: (a veil lies over their hearts)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV: "whenever"
* NIV, NLT: "when"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἂν ἀναγινώσκηται Μωϋσῆς
* _q1_: κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν κεῖται


## Notes
Verses 15 and 16 should be considered together. While v.15 contains the particle αν and v.16 contains the particle εαν, each has ηνικα "when" functioning together with the conditional particle to create a "whenever" sense in English.


----------------

<br/>q: (the veil is removed)

Verse 16 echos Exodus 34:34, that whenever Moses went in to meet with the LORD, he removed the veil. Paul is now applying this metaphorical idea of a veil to the Israelites (and all) who come to beleive in Christ and repent.


----------------

# 2 Cor 5:2-3

* _p1_: εἴ γε καὶ ἐνδυσάμενοι οὐ γυμνοὶ εὑρεθησόμεθα


## Notes
There is a wide range of translations of the phrase εἴ γε καὶ, indicating a lack of consensus on how it is excactly being used. There does not appear to be a clear conditional relationship between p and q.


----------------

# 2 Cor 5:9




## English

## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Ἑαυτοὺς πειράζετε εἰ ἐστὲ ἐν τῇ πίστει ἑαυτοὺς δοκιμάζετε


## Notes
εἰ introduces a question that is a dependent clause (the main clause has the verb πειράζετε 'test' in Greek and 'see' in English, so εἰ is functioning grammatically as a complementizer).


----------------

* NRSV: "for surely"
* NIV: "surely"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ γε ἠκούσατε τὴν οἰκονομίαν τῆς χάριτος τοῦ θεοῦ τῆς δοθείσης μοι εἰς ὑμᾶς


## Notes
εἴ γε 'if indeed'

Some commentators (Hoehner 2008; Arnold 2010) suggest that p consists of vs.2-12, and q is v.13. However, most translations do not treat this as a genuine conditional; Translator's Notes accepts the NIV's "surely" and states, "Paul was saying that he was sure that the Ephesian believers knew of his ministry of preaching the gospel."


----------------

# Eph 4:9

## English
p: (...but that he had also descended into the lower regions, the earth?)

## English
p: (so that whether I come and see you or am absent)
<br/>q: (I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for faith of the gospel)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "whether... or..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἵνα εἴτε ἐλθὼν καὶ ἰδὼν ὑμᾶς εἴτε ἀπὼν

# Phil 3:11




## English
p: (that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead)


* ESV: "that by any means possible"
* NASB: "in order that"
* RSV: "that if possible"
* NRSV: "if somehow"
* NIV: "and so, somehow"
* NLT: "so that one way or another"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ πως καταντήσω εἰς τὴν ἐξανάστασιν τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν


## Notes
Greek: ει πως + subjunctive ('if somehow I may')

The conditional is not "If I atttain resurrection from the dead" but "If there are any means possible by which I can attain resurrection of the dead" the latter which we know to be true. Thus Paul is not arguing that he has for certain gained resurrection from the dead, but that since it is a possibility he will do anything and everything to attain it.


----------------

# Phil 3:12


* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (but I press on)
<br/>p: (to make it my own)


* ESV, NRSV, NIV, NLT: (in order) "to" 
* NASB: "so that"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: διώκω δὲ
* _p1_: εἰ καὶ καταλάβω


## Notes
Greek εἰ καὶ 'even if, if indeed'

"it" refers to the righteousness which Paul talks about in 3:8-11, that he is working towards but has not yet attained.


----------------

# Phil 4:15


* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving)

* **Class:** 3


## English
p: (whatever you do)
<br/>q: (work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "whatever"


## Greek (SBLGNT)

# 1 Thess 2:7


* **Class:** 3
* **Inverse:** True


## English
ESV:
<br/>q: (but we were gentle among you)
<br/>p: (like a nursing mother taking care of her own children)
<br/>
<br/>NIV:
<br/>p: (just as a nursing mother cares for her children)
<br/>q (v.8): (so we cared for you)


* ESV, NRSV: "like"
* NASB: "as" 
* NIV: "just as"
* NLT: "or... like"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἀλλὰ ἐγενήθημεν ἤπιοι ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν
* _p1_: ὡς ἐὰν τροφὸς θάλπῃ τὰ ἑαυτῆς τέκνα


## Notes
ὡς ἐὰν 'as if'


----------------

# 1 Thess 5:10




## English
p: (whether we are awake or asleep)
<br/>q: ([Jesus] died for us so that ... we might live with him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "whether... or"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴτε γρηγορῶμεν εἴτε καθεύδωμεν
* _q1_: τοῦ ἀποθανόντος … ἡμῶν ἵνα … ἅμα σὺν αὐτῷ ζήσωμεν


## Notes
εἴτε

The conditionals "if we are awake or if we are asleep..." state that being alive or asleep (i.e. dead) makes no difference; we will live with him in either case. This can be expressed in English as 'whether we are alive or asleep/dead' or 'even if we are alive and even if we are asleep, we will live with him.'

This is an ‘alternative concessive conditional’ construction, in which the two 'conditional' clauses present an exhaustive set of alternatives, in this case being alive or being dead.

# 2 Thess 1:5-7


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (this is the evidence of the righteous judgement of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering)
<br/>p: (since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us)


* ESV: "since"
* NASB: "after all"
* NRSV: "indeed"
* NIV, NLT: untranslated/paraphrased


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: ἔνδειγμα τῆς δικαίας κρίσεως τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς τὸ καταξιωθῆναι ὑμᾶς τῆς βασιλείας τοῦ θεοῦ ὑπὲρ ἧς καὶ πάσχετε
* _p1_: εἴπερ δίκαιον παρὰ θεῷ ἀνταποδοῦναι τοῖς θλίβουσιν ὑμᾶς θλῖψιν καὶ ὑμῖν τοῖς θλιβομένοις ἄνεσιν μεθ ἡμῶν


## Notes
εἴπερ 'since, if indeed'


----------------

# 2 Thess 2:15


* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us...)
<br/>p: (...either by our spoken word or by our letter)


* ESV, NRSV: "either... or"
* NASB, NIV: "whether... or"
* NLT: "both... and"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: στήκετε καὶ κρατεῖτε τὰς παραδόσεις ἃς ἐδιδάχθητε
* _p1_: εἴτε διὰ λόγου εἴτε δι ἐπιστολῆς ἡμῶν


## Notes
εἴτε appears before 'word' and 'letter'


----------------

# 1 Tim 1:9-10


* **Class:** 1
* **Inverse:** True


## English
q: (the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and the sinners, for the unholy and the profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers)
<br/>p: (and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV: "whatever else"
* NLT: "anything else"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _q1_: εἰδὼς τοῦτο ὅτι δικαίῳ νόμος οὐ κεῖται ἀνόμοις δὲ καὶ ἀνυποτάκτοις ἀσεβέσι καὶ ἁμαρτωλοῖς ἀνοσίοις καὶ βεβήλοις πατρολῴαις καὶ μητρολῴαις ἀνδροφόνοις πόρνοις ἀρσενοκοίταις ἀνδραποδισταῖς ψεύσταις ἐπιόρκοις
* _p1_: εἴ τι ἕτερον τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ ἀντίκειται


## Notes
Greek: εἴ τι ἕτερον 'if any other thing'. This does not state a condition under which q holds, but rather ει τι functions as an indefinite pronoun. Similar to 2Co 2:10, 7:14.


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:5


* **Class:** 3
* **Probability:** Neutral
* **Time Orientation:** Gnomic
* **Illocutionary Force:** Exhort


## English
NASB (following Greek closely):
<br/>p1: (if anyone competes as an athlete,)
<br/>q1: (q2: [he does not win the prize] p2: [unless he competes according to the rules.])
<br/>
<br/>ESV: 
<br/>q: (An athlete is not crowned)
<br/>p: (unless he competes according to the rules)


* ESV, NLT: no conditional / "unless"
* NASB: "if anyone" / "unless"
* NRSV: "in the case of" / "without"
* NIV: "anyone who" / "except by"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν δὲ καὶ ἀθλῇ τις … ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ
* _q1_: οὐ στεφανοῦται


## Notes
This verse is grammatically complex because it has a conditional embedded within another conditional. Most translations simplify the grammar in some way. The first p seems to be presentational, introducing the topic of athletes, so in that sense, 2:5b-c is the true conditional (see ESV).

Paraphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless'):

p1 (if anyone competes as an athlete,) q1: (q2: [he wins the prize] p2: [only if he competes according to the rules.])

or:

q: (an athlete wins the prize) p: [only if he competes according to the rules.)

# 2 Tim 2:11


* **Class:** 1
* **Probability:** Factual
* **Time Orientation:** Past
* **Illocutionary Force:** Encourage


## English
p: (If we have died with him,)
<br/>q: (we will also live with him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ γὰρ συναπεθάνομεν
* _q1_: καὶ συζήσομεν


## Notes
The conditionals of 2:11-13 are a Christian hymn modified by Paul for this context, rather than a logical argument .

2Ti 2:11 is very similar to Rom 6:8. Given the connection with baptism in Romans 6, Paul's theology, and the fact that this p is in the aorist, this is clearly a factual conditional.


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:12a


* **Class:** 1
* **Probability:** Neutral
* **Time Orientation:** Gnomic
* **Illocutionary Force:** Exhort / Warn


## English
p: (if we endure,)
<br/>q: (we will also reign with him)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ὑπομένομεν
* _q1_: καὶ συμβασιλεύσομεν


## Notes
Mounce (2000) claims that there is an implied warning in this verse. Unlike v.11, the final three conditionals in this hymn have a neutral probability.


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:12b


* **Class:** 1
* **Probability:** Neutral
* **Time Orientation:** Gnomic
* **Illocutionary Force:** Warn


## English
p: (if we deny him,)
<br/>q: (he also will deny us;)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα
* _q1_: κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται ἡμᾶς


## Notes
Mounce (2000) claims that 2:12b refers to total apostasy whereas 2:13 refers to temporary disobedience.


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:13


* **Class:** 1
* **Probability:** Neutral
* **Time Orientation:** Gnomic
* **Illocutionary Force:** Encourage


## English
p: (if we are faithless,)
<br/>q: (he remains faithful)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ ἀπιστοῦμεν
* _q1_: ἐκεῖνος πιστὸς μένει


## Notes
See note at 2:12b.

Q is true regardless of the validity of p, so this could be interpreted as a concessive condtional: "even if we are are unfaithful, he remains faithful."


----------------

# 2 Tim 2:21


* **Class:** 3
* **Probability:** Neutral
* **Time Orientation:** Gnomic
* **Illocutionary Force:** Encourage


## English
p: (if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable,)
<br/>q: (he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.)


* ESV, NASB: "if anyone'"
* NRSV: "all who"
* NIV: "those who"
* NLT: "if you"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: ἐὰν οὖν τις ἐκκαθάρῃ ἑαυτὸν ἀπὸ τούτων
* _q1_: ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν ἡγιασμένον εὔχρηστον τῷ δεσπότῃ εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἡτοιμασμένον


## Notes
This conditional introduces the topic of people who are cleansed from moral wrong.


----------------

# Titus 1:6


* **Class:** 1
* **Probability:** Neutral
* **Time Orientation:** Present
* **Illocutionary Force:** Assert


## English
p: (...if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination)
<br/>q: (IMPLIED: appoint such a person)


* ESV: "if anyone"
* NASB: "if any man"
* NRSV: "someone who"
* NIV, NLT: no conditional, "an elder must..."


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἀνέγκλητος μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἀνήρ τέκνα ἔχων πιστά μὴ ἐν κατηγορίᾳ ἀσωτίας ἢ ἀνυπότακτα


## Notes
Paul is giving Titus a guideline for appointing elders. This conditional lists the attributes of an elder; however, q is left implicit. The conditional expression εἴ τίς 'if anyone' can equally well be treated as an indefinite pronoun as in NRSV "someone".


----------------

# Phlm 1:17


* **Class:** 1
* **Probability:** Factual
* **Time Orientation:** Present
* **Illocutionary Force:** Request


## English
p: (so if you consider me your partner)
<br/>q: (receive him as you would receive me)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: Εἰ οὖν με ἔχεις κοινωνόν
* _q1_: προσλαβοῦ αὐτὸν ὡς ἐμέ


## Notes
Philemon knows that Paul considers him a partner. Paul is making his request on the basis of that relationship.


----------------

# Phlm 1:18


* **Class:** 1
* **Probability:** Very Likely or Factual
* **Time Orientation:** Present
* **Illocutionary Force:** Command


## English
p: (if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything)
<br/>q: (charge that to my account)


* ESV, NASB, NRSV, NIV, NLT: "if"


## Greek (SBLGNT)
* _p1_: εἰ δέ τι ἠδίκησέν σε ἢ ὀφείλει
* _q1_: τοῦτο ἐμοὶ ἐλλόγα


## Notes
Paul is sending Onesimus, a slave, back to Philemon, his master. It is highly likely that Philemon feels that Onesimus has done him wrong. By asking Philemon to charge everything owed to his (Paul's) account, Paul is taking on the responsibility for paying what Onesimus owes.
